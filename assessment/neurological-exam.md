#Neurological Examination
The neurological exam comes in several flavours, depending on the patient:
* Paralysed
* Unconscious
* Uncooperative
* Cooperative

##Extremities
* Observation
    * Tremors
    * Wasting
    * Fasciculations
        * Intrinsic hand muscles
        * Shoulder girdle
        * Thigh
* Tone
    * Passive movement of each joint
* Power and movement
    * Drift
    * Rapid movements
    * Power

Upper versus Lower Motor Neuron Lesions:

|Finding|UMN|LMN|
|--|--|--|
|Atrophy|No|Yes
|Fasciculations|No|Yes
|Reflexes|Increased|Decreased
|Tone|Increased|Decreased
|Weakness|Yes|Yes

##Cranial Nerves
* Light reflex
    * Can be performed in paralysed patient
    * Afferent pathway via CN II
    * Efferent pathway via CN III
    * Abnormalities between direct and consensual reflexes allow localisation of the lesion to a particular neural pathway
* Visual acuity  
Tests CN II
    * Visual fields
        * Patient focuses straight ahead
        * Reports when a finger is moving in each quadrant
    * Visual extinction
        * Form of neglect
        * Patient is presented with a different number of fingers on each side
        * The patient will not report seeing the fingers on the affected side when presented to both sides, but can see them when presented to the affected side alone

* Vestibulo-ocular reflex  
Tests CN III, IV, V, VIII.
    * A more mild version of the cold caloric reflex that can be performed in unconscious patients
    * The eyes are held open and the head is rotated side-to-side or up and down
    * The reflex is present if the eyes move in the opposite direction of head movements (**doll's esyes**)
    * Absence of the reflex is suggestive of brainstem dysfunction in the comatose patient

* Extra-ocular movements  
Tests CN III, IV, V
    * Patient focuses straight ahead
    * Eyes follow finger in an 'H' pattern
    * Diplopia:
        * Movement limitation
        * Dysconjugate gaze:
        * Horizontal
        * Vertical
* Facial Sensation
    * In the unconscious patient:
        * Corneal Reflex  
Tests CN V, VII.
    * Supra orbital notch pressure  
Tests CN V, VII.
    * Trigeminal sensation  
Tests CN V.

* Facial Expression
Tests CN VII.
    * Evaluate strength and asymmetry as the patient:
        * Wrinkles brow
        * Closes eyes tightly
        * Puffs out cheeks
        * Smiles    
* SCM and trapezius  
Tests CN XI.
    * Evaluate strength as the patient:
        * Shrugs shoulders
        * Turns head to each side

* Cold caloric reflex  
Tests CN III, VIII.
    * Used in brain-death testing
    * Cold water is syringed into the patients ear
    * A positive reflex occurs when the eyes look towards the tested side.

* Gag reflex  
Tests CN IX, X.
    * Touch the posterior pharynx on each side (use a Yankeur).
    * A gag is a positive response.

* Cough reflex  
Tests CN X.
    * Suctioning the trachea should cause a cough response.

* Tongue  
Tests CN XII.
    * Atrophy  
Occurs with LMN lesion.
    * Fasciculations  
Occurs with LMN lesions.
    * Deviation  
Weakness causes deviation to the affected side.
    * Push forcefully against inside of the cheek

##Cerebellar Exam
* Nystagmus
    * A fast phase of nystagmus will occur towards the side of a cerebellar lesion
* Resting tremor
* Tests of coordination:
    * Rapid alternating movements
    * Finger-nose
    * Heel-shin
* Gait
    * Heel-toe
* Romberg's test
    * Patient stands with eyes closed
    * A positive result occurs if the patient loses balance
        * Cerebellar ataxia occurs even when the eyes are open
        * Sensory ataxia occurs when the eyes are closed, and is a sign of disturbed proprioception
