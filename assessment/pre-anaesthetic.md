#Pre-Anaesthetic Assessment

Preoperative assessment is divided into:
* History
* Examination

##History
This assessment template uses the mnemonic **IIF AMPLE**. Fasting status is in there twice, to ensure it's not forgotten.

* **Identification** of the patient
* **Indication** for surgery
* **Fasting** status


* **Allergies**  
	* Including issues with **previous anaesthetic**
	* **Family history** of **anaesthetic issues**
		* MH
		* Atypical cholinesterase
		* Other reactions
* **Medications**  
In particular:
	* Respiratory drugs
	* Cardiac drugs
	* Opioid/analgesic use and tolerance
	* Drugs with many side-effects or interactions
	* Drugs which should be **ceased perioperatively**
		* OHGs  
		Morning of surgery.
		* Antidepressants  
		Morning of surgery.
	* Drugs which should be **adjusted perioperatively**
		* Insulins
		* Anticoagulants, some antiplatelets
		* Steroids
		* Bronchodilators  
		Give preoperatively.
	* Drugs which should be **initiated perioperatively**
		* Consider beta-blockade  
		In those with increased risk of stroke, inducible ischaemia, CAD, multiple CVS risk factors.
			* Note that cardioselective Î²-blockers do not increase bronchospasm risk in short term
	* Alcohol use
	* Drug use
* **Past Medical History**
	* Previous surgeries
	* Previous anaesthetics
		* Previous airway management difficulty
		* PONV
	* Respiratory disease
		* Asthma  
		Increased risk of bronchospasm from intubation & desflurane
			* Consider cancellation or delaying elective procedures in poorly controlled asthma
		* Smoking  
		Impaired mucous secretion & clearance, decreased small airway calibre, altered immune response.
			* Cease 8 weeks prior to OT if possible
			* Abstaining 24/24 prior has benefit
		* COAD  
		Increased risk of atelectasis, bronchospasm, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, respiratory failure.
		* Recent URTI
		* OSA
	* Cardiac disease
		* CAD  
		CCS Angina class.
		* MI  
		 Recommend postponing elective operations 4-6/52 following an MI - increased risk of reinfarction/death (periop MI mortality is 20-50%).
		 	* <3/12: 37% chance reinfarction
		 	* 3-6/12: 15% chance reinfarction
		 	* > 6/12: Constant 5% risk
		 	* If surgery cannot be avoided, post-op ICU monitoring decreases risk to 6%, 2%, 1% respectively
		* CHF  
		NYHA class.
		* Valvular disease
		* Arrhythmias
		* PVD
		* Exercise tolerance
	* Neurological disease
		* Seizures
		* CVA
		* Raised ICP
		* Spinal disease
		* Neuromuscular disease
	* GIT
		* GORD
		* Hepatic disease
	* Renal
		* Insufficiency
		* Dialysis
	* Haematological diseases
		* Objection to blood products
		* History of bleeding problems
		* Anaemia
		* Coaguolpathy
		* Dyscrasias
	* MSK
		* Arthropathies
		* Cervical spine disease  
		Abscess, trauma, tumours, scleroderma, obesity fixation.
	* Endocrine disease
		* Diabetes  
		Including complications:
			* CVS
			* Renal
			* Neuropathy
		* Thyroid
		* Adrenal
	* Pregnancy
		* Issues with this pregnancy
		* Issues with previous pregnancies
		* Problems with prior epidurals
* **Last eaten**
* **Events**  
Of the last 24 hours and concurrent illnesses.

##Examination
Examination follows an ABCDE approach:
* Airway assessment:
	* **Previous grade** of intubation
	* Ability to assume sniffing position/cervical spine stiffness
	* Mallampati:
		1: Full visibility of tonsils, uvula and soft palate
		2: Visibility of hard and soft palate, upper portion of tonsils and uvula
		3: Soft and hard palate and base of uvula visible
		4: Only hard palate visible
	* Thyromental distance  
	Distance of lower mandible in the midline from the mentum to the thyroid notch.
		* < 6cm is associated with difficult intubation
	* Mouth opening
		* < 2 finger breadths is associated with difficult intubation
	* Tongue size
	* Dentition
* Breathing assessment
* CVS asssessment
* Neuro assessment
* Extremity assessment
	* Cannula sites
	* Bony landmarks and anatomy for regional techniques
* Fluid state
	* Filling state
	* Nutritional state

##Checklist
An alternative pre-anaesthetic/peri-operative checklist is also described using the mnemonic A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2</sub>E<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>G<sub>2</sub>:
* **Affirmative history**
	* Surgical condition
	* Past illnesses and treatment
* **Airway**
	* Perform a detailed airway exam
* **Blood loss**
	* Current Hb
	* Blood loss estimation
	* Blood availability
* **Breathing**
	* Respiratory examination
* **Clinical exam**  
	* Cardiac examination
	* Exertional tolerance
* **Co-morbidities**  
Particualarly DM, HTN, asthma, epilepsy.
* **Drugs**  
Current medications and anaesthesia plan.
* **Details**  
Of previous anaesthetics and surgeries.
* **Evaluate** investigations  
Other relevant investigations.
* **End point** to take up the case for surgery  
Conduct operation if further postponement will not be beneficial.
* **Fluid** status
* **Fasting** status
* **Give physical status
* **Get consent**
