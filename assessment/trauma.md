#Trauma Approach

*This section covers clinical assessment of the trauma patient, and likely injuries based on mechanism.*

>* Volume resuscitation is not a substitute for haemorrhage control
>* Shock in the trauma patient is almost always hypovolaemic  
>Causes of shock in trauma:
>	* Haemorrhage
>	* Haemorrhage
>	* Haemorrhage
>	* Obstructive
>	* Distributive


Assessment of the trauma patient can be divided into:
* History
* Primary Survey
* Secondary Survey
* Tertiary Survey

##History
History should include:
* Allergies
* Medication
* PMHx
* Last eaten
* Events  
	* Mechanism
	* Injuries
		* Blood loss at scene
		* Open wounds/fractures  
		Potential contaminants.
	* Symptoms
	* Treatment

###Mechanism
Injury patterns relate to mechanism of injury:
* **MVA**
	* Position
	* Use of restrains
		* Lap belt
		* Three-point restraints
	* External damage to vehicle
	* Internal damage to vehicle
	* Speed  
	Pre and post-crash.
	* Direction of impact
	* Injuries to other passengers
* **Fall**
	* Distance
	* Landing
	* Surface
* **Crush**
	* Weight of object
	* Site
	* Duration of entrapment
* **Burns**
	* Time
	* Duration
	* Enclosed space
	* Protectie equipment
	* Agent
* **Explosion**
	* Magnitude
	* Distance
	* Enclosed space
	* Secondary projectiles
	* Sources of bacterial contamination


##Primary Survey
> * Aims to **identify and treat immediately life threatening injuries**
> * These injuries should be **actively looked for and excluded**:
>	* **A**irway Obstruction
>	* **T**ension Pneumothorax
>	* **O**pen Pneumothorax
>	* **M**assive haemorrhage
>	* **H**aemothorax
>	* **F**lail Chest and pulmonary contusion
>	* **C**ardiac Tamponade

The primary survey follows the **CABCD** approach:
* **Safe Approach**  
Ensure the approach to the patient is safe.
* **C**  
Control of massive external haemorrhage.
	* Control of immediately life threatening bleeds only
	* Typically applies to extremety trauma  
	* Interventions  
	**DDIT**:
		* Direct Pressure
		* Direct Pressure (more)
		* Indirect Pressure  
		To artery proximal to injury.
		* **Torniquets**
		* Consider:
			* Wound packing
			* Haemostatic agents


* **A**  
Airway assessment and immediate management:
	* Rapid Assessment:  
	Ask the patient to:
		* **Identify themselves and what happened**  
		This indicates airway patency, adequate breathing, conscious state.
		* Open their mouth
		* Take two deep breaths
		* Cough
		* Ask: "Does your breathing feel normal?"  
		If the above are normal, then the chance of a serious breathing problem is unlikely.
		* Ask: "Where do you hurt?"
		* Ask: "Where else do you hurt?"
	* Check for **threatened airway**:
		* Unconsciousness/obtundation  
		Loss of airway reflexes.
		* **Patency**
			* Look for obstruction or foreign body
			* Listen for stridor, gurgling, abnormal phonation
			* Consider:
				* Facial, mandibular, tracheal, or laryngeal fractures
	* Interventions to restore patency:
		* Basic manouvres
		* Place OPA
		* Intubate  
		Consider when:
			* Patient, team, and environment are optimised.  
			Roles assigned (including MILS).
			* SpO2 < 93%
			* GCS < 8



* **B**  
Assess breathing (**RU IN SHAPE**). If there are no signs of life, commence traumatic cardiac arrest protocol.
	* Respiratory Rate
		* RR > 20
		* RR < 8
	* Unequal movements
	* Injuries  
	Major thoracic trauma.
	* Search
	* Hands on  
	Palpate.
	* Auscultate
	* Percuss
	* (Everywhere)
	* Interventions  
	The respiratory support ladder:
		* Rescue  
		If entrapped.
		* Optimise positioning
		* Oxygen
		* Analgesia
		* NIV
		* Decompression
		* RSI


* **C**  
Assess perfusion:
	* GCS
	* Capillary return  
	Central >3 seconds.
	* Pulse  
		* Present
		* \>120
	* Fluid responsiveness
	* Actively look for sources of bleeding  
	**SCALPER**:
		* Scalp
		* Chest
		* Abdomen  
			* Pain on palpation away from bruises
			* Fat fractures suggest high risk of hollow organ injury  
			Divet felt under intact skin.
		* Long Bones
		* Pelvis  
			* Pain suggests pelvic injury
		* External  
		"The Floor."
		* Retroperitoneum


* **D**  
Assess neurology:
	* GCS
	* Pupillary size and reaction
	* Focal defect
	* Spinal Cord Injury level


* **E**  
Exposure and extremities:
	* Completely undress
	* Logroll
	* **Cover and rewarm**

###Adjuncts to the Primary Survey
* **A**
	* Capnography  
	Confirm ETT position.
* **C**
	* Ultrasound  
	FAST scanning:
		* Free fluid in abdomen
		* Pneumothorax in chest
	* ECG
		* Dysrhythmias/ST segement changes  
		May indicate blunt cardiac injury or causative event (e.g. MI leading to MVC).
	* IDC
		* Consider filling bladder to tamponade pelvic venous bleeds 

##Secondary Survey
> * Only begins once primary survey is completed and resuscitation is underway
> * Aims to identify important, but not immediately treatable life-threatening (or **immediately treatable**) life-threatening injuries
> * The following injuries should be **actively looked for and excluded** during the secondary survey:  
>Imaging will be required.
>	* Tracheobronchial tree injury
>	* Pneumothorax
>	* Pulmonary contusions
>	* Haemothorax
>	* Blunt cardiac injury
>	* Traumatic aortic injury
>	* Oesophageal rupture
>	* Traumatic diaphragmatic injury


The secondary survey is a thorough head-to-toe evaluation, including complete history, physical examination, and reassessment of vitals.

* Head
	* Scalp & Skull  
	Lacerations and fractures.
	* Brief cranial nerve examination
	* Eye
		* Acuity
		* Mobility  
		May be reduced with entrapment.
		* Pupil size
		* Penetrating injury
		* **Contact lenses**
		* Lens dislocation
	* Ear
		* BoS fracture
		* Membrane integrity
	* Midface
	* Mandible


* Neck
	* C-spine tenderness
	* SC emphysema
	* Tracheal deviation
	* Laryngeal fracture
	* Carotid palpation and auscultation
		* Overlying blunt injury may require angiography
		* Blunt carotid injuries may cause intimal tears and present late
	* Lacerations
	* Distension of neck veins
		* Tamponade/tension pneumothorax will increase right sided filling pressures and raise CVP
		* Hypovolaemia will reduce filling pressures


* Chest
	* Palpate ribs, clavicle, sternum
	* Auscultate anterior chest wall and bases


* Abdomen


* Pelvis
	* Bruising of iliac wings, scrotum/labia suggests pelvic fracture
	* Pelvic spring
	* Rectal examination
		* If mechanism suggests injury
		* If patient is unconscious
	* Vaginal examination
		* If mechanism suggests injury
		* Consider retained **tampon**


* Extremities
	* Tenderness
	* Abnormal movement  
	The ability to move a joint through its full range of motion usually indicates that the muscle unit is intact and the joint is stable.
	* Distal pulses  

###Adjuncts
* X-Ray
	* CXR
	* Pelvis
	* Long bones
* CT
