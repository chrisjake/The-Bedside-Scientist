#Trauma Approach

*This section covers clinical assessment of the trauma patient, and likely injuries based on mechanism.*

>* Volume resuscitation is not a substitute for haemorrhage control
>* Shock in the trauma patient is almost always hypovolaemic

Assessment of the trauma patient can be divided into:
* History
* Primary Survey
* Secondary Survey
* Tertiary Survey

##History


##Primary Survey
>* External bleeding should be controlled during the primary survey

The primary survey aims to identify and treat immediately life threatening injuries, and follows the **CABCD** approach:
* **Safe Approach**  
Ensure the approach to the patient is safe.
* **C**  
Control of massive external haemorrhage.
	* Control of immediately life threatening bleeds only
	* Typically applies to extremety trauma  
	* Interventions:  
	**DDIT**.
		* Direct Pressure
		* Direct Pressure (more)
		* Indirect Pressure  
		To artery proximal to injury.
		* **Torniquets**
		* Consider:
			* Wound packing
			* Haemostatic agents


* **A**  
Airway assessment and immediate managemnt:
	* Ask the patient to **identify themselves and what happened**  
	This indicates airway patency, adequate breathing, conscious state.
	* Evaluate for **threatened airway**:
		* Unconsciousness
		* **Patency**
			* Look for obstruction or foreign body
			* Facial, mandibular, tracheal, or laryngeal fractures which may cause obstruction
	* Interventions to restore patency:
		* Basic manouvres
		* Place OPA
		* Intubate  
		Consider when:
			* Patient, team, and environment are optimised.  
			Roles assigned (including MILS).
			* SpO2 < 93%
			* GCS < 8


* **B**  
Assess breathing (**RU IN SHAPE**). If no signs of life, go to traumatic cardiac arrest:
	* Respiratory Rate
		* RR > 20
		* RR < 8
	* Unequal movements
	* Injuries  
	Major thoracic trauma.
	* Search
	* Hands on  
	Palpate.
	* Auscultate
	* Percuss
	* (Everywhere)
	* Interventions  
	The respiratory support ladder:
		* Rescue  
		If entrapped.
		* Optimise positioning
		* Oxygen
		* Analgesia
		* NIV
		* Decompression
		* RSI

* **C**  
Assess perfusion:
	* GCS
	* Capillary return  
	Central > 3 seconds.
	* Pulse  
		* Present
		* > 120
	* Fluid responsiveness
	* Look for sources of bleeding  
	**SCALPER**:
		* Scalp
		* Chest
		* Abdomen
		* Long Bones
		* Pelvis
		* External  
		"The Floor."
		* Retroperitoneum


* **D**  
Assess neurology:
	* GCS
	* Pupillary size and reaction
	* Focal defect
	* Spinal Cord Injury level


* **E**  
Exposure and extremities:
	* Completely undress
	* Logroll
	* **Cover and rewarm**

###Adjuncts to the Primary Survey
* **A**
	* Capnography  
	Confirm ETT position.
* **C**
	* Ultrasound  
	FAST scanning:
		* Free fluid in abdomen
		* Pneumothorax in chest
	* ECG
		* Dysrhythmias/ST segement changes  
		May indicate blunt cardiac injury or causative event (e.g. MI leading to MVC).
	* IDC
		* Consider filling bladder to tamponade pelvic venous bleeds 

##Secondary Survey
> * Only begins once primary survey is completed and resuscitation is underway

The secondary survey is a head-to-toe evaluation, including complete history, physical examination, and reassessment of vitals.

* Head
	* Scalp & Skull
	Lacerations and fractures.
	* Brief cranial nerve examination
	* Eye
		* Acuity
		* Mobility  
		May be reduced with entrapment.
		* Pupil size
		* Penetrating injury
		* **Contact lenses**
		* Lens dislocation
	* Ear
		* BoS fracture
		* Membrane integrity


* Neck
	* C-spine tenderness
	* SC emphysema
	* Tracheal deviation
	* Laryngeal fracture
	* Carotid palpation and auscultation
		* Overlying blunt injury may require angiography
		* Blunt carotid injuries may cause intimal tears and present late
	* Lacerations
	* Distension of neck veins
		* Tamponade/tension pneumothorax will increase right sided filling pressures and raise CVP
		* Hypovolaemia will reduce filling pressures


* Chest
	* Palpate ribs, clavicle, sternum
	* Auscultate anterior chest wall and bases


* Abdomen


* Pelvis
	* Bruising of iliac wings, scrotum/labia suggests pelvic fracture
	* Pelvic spring


* Limbs
	* Tenderness
	* Abnormal movement

###Adjuncts
* X-Ray
	* CXR
	* Pelvis
	* Long bones
* CT
