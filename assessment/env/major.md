#Major Incident Assessment and Medical Management

A major incident occurs when the location, number, severity, or type of live casualties requires extraordinary resources. Major incidents can be:
* Natural of man-made
* Simple or compound  
A compound incident occcurs when releveant infrastructure (roads, hospitals, and lines of communication) is also disrupted/destroyed.
* Compensated or uncompensated  
An uncompensated incident occurs when the casualties exceed the resources to treat them. An incident may:
	* Move from uncompensated to compensated as additional resources are mobilised
	* Be more likely to be uncompensated when:
		* Surge capacity planning has not occured
		* Resources are lacking  
		Remote regions are more likely to experience an uncompenated incident for any given casualty load.
		* Confounding factors

Casualty numbers:
* Major  
Incident handled by resources of individual hospitals.
* Mass  
Incident overwhelms response. May involve closure or evacuation of health facility, or persistent disruption over many days.
* Catastrophic  
Severe disruption to health and social care and other supportive infrastructure (e.g. water, electricity, transport).

##Preparation
Emergency preparation is vital to limiting extent and severity of an incident. Preparedness involves:
* Preparation
	* Planning
		* Health service plans
			* Ambulance service plan
			* Internal hospital plans  
			Based on number and likely type of casualties for the incident.
		* High-risk venue plans  
		e.g. Stadiums, festivals, protests are all high-risk settings.
		* Government plans  
		Regional/State/National plans for coordinating rsources.
		* Creating surge capacity
			* Inter- and intra-agency written protocols
			* Succession planning within organisations
			* Backup radio and communication networks
			* Equipment stockpiles
			* Sources of transport  
			Agreements to obtain commercial or military vehicles.
	* Equipment
		* PPE
		* Tools and extraction equipment
		* Medical equipment  
		Appropriate to level of skill and training of providers.
	* Training
		* Education  
		Should precede exercise, so the maximum value of the exercise is realised.
		* Exercises  
			* May involve:
				* Table-top exercises
				* Triage exercises with simulated casualties
				* Communication exercises
				* Practical exercises without casualties
				* Virtual responses
				* Multi-agency exercises
			* Include:
				* Level A  
				Major live multi-agency exercise.
				* Level B  
				Major table-top multi-agency exercise.
				* Level C  
				Local level exercise examining a specific issue.
* Response
* Recovery


##Incident Response
Response involves:
* Command and Control
* Scene layout
* Safety
* Establishing communications
* Conducting initial assessment

###Command and Control
* Command  
Held by each emergency service at scene.
	* Runs vertically in each service
* Control  
Held by **one** service at scene.
	* Runs horizontally **across the services**  
	* In Australia, service in control will depend on the nature of the incident


Tiers of Command:
* Strategic/Gold Command
	* Usually only one Gold Command
	* Cross state/national boundaries may require multi-agency gold command  
	Regional or national ocoordination may be established above this; known as platinum command.
	* Supports tactical command
* Tactical/Silver Command  
	* Commanders of each service  
	Co-location of service commanders forms Joint Services Emergency Control.
	* Located inside the outer cordon
	* Allocate resouces to operaetional commanders
* Operational/Bronze Command
	* Multiple bronze commanders dealing with particular sectors
	* Oversee operational activities

###Layout
Scene layout:
* Outer cordon  
Prevents access by general public. Usually established and maintained by police.
* Inner cordon  
Area around scene, outside of which service facilities are established.

Health service response requires:
* Ambulance Command Point  
Ambulance command vehicle.
	* May be co-located with other service command vehicles to form the Joint Services Emergency Control (JSEC)
	* Reporting point for all health personnel
* Ambulance Parking Point  
Holding bay for ambulances when not on tasking.
* Forward Control Point  
Area close to the incident, where the forward commander can direct operations. May be multiple forward control points, with multiple forward commanders.
* Ambulance Loading Point  
Area where ambulances collect casualties from CCS.
* Casualty Clearing Station  
Point of secondary triage and casualty treatment. Should be:
	* Safe
	* Accessible:
		* From the scene
		* To evacuation routes
	* Sheltered
	* Well-lit
	* Of appropriate size

###Safety
Code of safety is the '1-2-3' of safety:
1. Self
	* Adequate PPE
	* Personal identification
	* Communication tools
	* Torch
2. Scene
3. Survivors  
Prevent further casualties.


Risk Asseessment:
* Look for hazards
* Decide:
	* Who is at risk
	* How they are at risk
* Evaluate degree of risk
* Determine how to remove or minimise risk


Safe approaches:
* Approach upwind  
Minimise exposure to contamination.
* Report to rendevous point  
Ensures reporting and appropriate deployment.
* Check in with emergency vehicles close to scene  
May be standing off.
* Aim to stay at least 100m away from incident  
Minimise risk of injury from secondary blast.
* Retreat if continuous loud noises  
May indicate leak present.
* Wear maximal PPE

###Communication
> Poor communication is the commonest failing at the scene of a major incident

Key messages:
* Major incident - standby  
Alerts hospital that a major incident is possible.
* Major incident declared  
Incident has occured and the response is enacted.
* Major incident - cancelled  
Above order rescinded.


###Scene Assessment  
Initial assessment:
* Should be rapid
* Determines speed and adequacy of initial response
* Performed using **METHANE**:
	* **M**ajor Incident  
	Advise standby or declared.
	* **E**xact Location  
	Accurate as possible: grid reference, site, landmarks.
	* **T**ype of Incident  
	e.g. Road traffic, chemical, rail.
	* **H**azards  
	Actual and potential.
	* **A**ccess/Egress  
	Safe direction for approaches and departures.
	* **N**umber of casualties  
	May include severity and type.
	* **E**mergency services  
	Present and/or required.


Ongoing assessment can be covered with **HANE**.

Achieved with:
	* Restrictions
		* Create a media rendevous point
		* Restrict access to scene
	* Provision of information
		* Media Liason Officer
		* Media rendevous point
		* Regular information updates
		* Parking for broadcast vehicles

* CBRN incidents
* High paediatric casualties  
Requires specialised equipment and staffing. May involve evacuation to paediatric centres far from incident location.
* High burns casualties  
	* Requires attendance by burns assessment team  
	Usually registrar/specialist and burns nurse deployed to each ED.
	* Often requires evacuation to centres far from incident location

###Scene Considerations
Determine the:
* Cold zone  
Uncontaminated area between inner and outer cordons.
* Warm zone  
Area contaminated by movement of people and vehicles to and from the hot zone.
* Hot zone  
Contaminated area where substances disperse to.


Signs of contamination:
* Dead birds/fish/insects
* PHysical symptoms
* Mass casualties
* Unusual liquid droplets
	* Oily film on water
* Dead plant life
* Unexplained odours  
Fruit, flowery, sharp, pungent, garlic, hay.
