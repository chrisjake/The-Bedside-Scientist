		* Ventilator disconnected whilst delivering 100% O<sub>2</sub> at 6L/min through a suction catheter close to the carina
		* Confirmed positive when there is no respiratory effort when:
			* PaCO<sub>2</sub> is ≥60mmHg, OR
			* PaCO<sub>2</sub> has risen 20mmHg above baseline
* A patient who is:
	* Normothermic  
	≥ 36.5°C.
	* Normotensive
