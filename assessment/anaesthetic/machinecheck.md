#Anaesthetic Machine Check

An anaesthesia delivery system includes any equipment that can deliver gases, vapours, local anaesthetic or intravenous anaesthetic agents.

##Process
There are three levels of machine check:
* **Level One Check**  
Detailed check performed by trained service personenel of all systems prior to being used.
* **Level Two Check**  
Check performed at that start of each anaesthetic list.
* **Level Three Check**  
Check performed prior to commencing anaesthesia for each patient.


###Level Two Check

1. Check gas pressures
	* Supply line pressures
	* Reserve O<sub>2</sub> cylinder pressure
		* Adequate pressure  
		\>10,000 kPa.
		* Can be turned on and off  
		Leave off after check so that there is no slow leak.
		* Not leaking from seal
2. Check gas flows
	* Check that each gas flow is measured correctly on each rotameter
	* Verify that the anti-hypoxic systems are working correctly
		* FiO<sub>2</sub> should not be able to be reduced to <0.21
3. Check scavenging  
Connected and flow is adequate.
4. Check vapourisers
	* Filled with liquid anaesthetic
	* Seated and detected appropriately
5. Check CO<sub>2</sub>
	* Check soda lime
	* Check ETCO<sub>2</sub> working
6. Check for circuit leak  
	* Leak should be â‰¤300ml/min for a circuit pressure >30cm H<sub>2</sub>O
	* Usually automated in modern machines
7. **Manual circuit check**  
Attach a circuit bag to the patient y-piece and test:
	* Circuit compliance
	* Circuit resistance
	* Valve movement
	* APL valve function  
	Compress both circuit bag and breathing bag.
8. **Verify BVM is present**
9. **Check emergency drugs**

###Level Three Check

The level three check involves checking any piece of equipment that has been changed.

###Intravenous Anaesthesia Delivery Systems
* Device is powered and functions correctly
* Drug is correctly labelled and loaded
* Correct programming of:
	* Syringe type and volume
	* Drug used and concentration
	* Flow rate and units
	* Alarm parameters
* Antireflux valve placed
* Secure connections
* No leakage

##Principles
* Facility must designate an individual responsible for servicing and maintenance
* Anaesthesia delivery systems should be serviced regularly
* Alarms and monitoring should comply with ANZCA standards
* Secondary means of oxygenation and positive pressure ventilation should be available
