#Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy

>Airway: Requires either a south RAE, reinforced ETT, or flexible LMA. <br>
>Access: 22G-18G, depending on  age.<br>
>Pain: Moderate; see below. <br>
>Position: Supine, head elevated with neck extended. <br>
>Time: 30-60min. <br>
>Blood loss: Usually minimal; ~4ml/kg in children. May be difficult to estimate if blood enters stomach.<br>
>Special: Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis are usually not required. <br>


*This covers anaesthesia for elective tonsillectomy. Anaesthetic management of the bleeding tonsil is [covered elsewhere](/anaesthesia/ent/bleeding-tonsil.md).*


Removal of tonsils and adenoids. Performed for either:
* Chronic infection  
Usually appropriate for day-surgery provided oral intake is tolerated post-operatively.
* OSA

##Considerations
* Indication for surgery  
Primary pathology may affect choice of predmedication, opioids, and choice of discharge destination.
* A
	* Risk of difficult mask ventilation and intubation
	* Discussion with surgeon about preferred airway
* B
	* Presence and severity of OSA will affect
		* Secondary effects
			* CO<sub>2</sub> retention
			* Failure to thrive
			* Cor pulmonale
		* Sensitivity to opioids and sedatives  
		Generally **avoid premedication** in paediatric cohort.
		* Post-operative destination  
		* Awake vs. deep extubation
* G
	* PONV prevention  
	Suggest 0.5mg/kg of dexamethasone.
* H
	* Coagulopathy

##Preparation
* Standard ANZCA monitoring in adults


##Induction
* Gas induction  
Common in children.
* IV induction may be safer in severe OSA


* Airway obstruction is common  
Often require CPAP to alleviate.


* Intubation
	* Careful laryngoscopy to avoid bleeding from enlarged tonsils and adenoids
* Laryngeal mask  
Reduced incidence of post-extubation complications.

##Intraoperative
Maintenance with:
* Propofol/remifentanil  
Smooth haemodynamics and emergence.
* Deep volatile


###Analgesia Strategies
> Goal is to provide adequate analgesia and avoid post-operative apnoeas

A recipe:
* Dexamethasone 0.2mg/kg
* Paracetamol 15mg/kg
* Parecoxib 1mg/kg

Opioid strategy will depend on degree of OSA:
* No OSA  
	* Morphine 0.1-0.2mg/kg.
* Mild OSA
	* Fentanyl 1-2mcg/kg
	* Tramadol 2mg/kg
* Severe OSA
	* Fentanyl 1-2mcg/kg
	* Ketamine

###Surgical Stages
* Positioning
* Insertion of mouth gag  
	* May **compress ETT** if not using a reinforced tube
	* Highly stimulating
	* May dislodge ETT
* Adenoidectomy  
If performed, will be removed with a curette.
* Packing of nasopharynx
* Tonsillectomy
	* Superior pole drawn medially
	* Dissected from the tonsillar pillar and removed
* Haemostasis  


##Postoperative
Emergence is **critical**:
* **Remove throat pack**  
If used. Suction stomach if not used.
* **Careful suctioning**  
Under vision.
* Consider **deep extubation**
	* Most suitable in small children
	* Place left lateral, head-down  
	Leave until fully awake.
* Avoid coughing

Risk factors for post-operative airway events:
* Age < 3 years
* Severe OSA
* Ex-premature
* Under-overweight
* Syndromic
* Significant cardio/respiratory disease
* Intercurrent RTI
* Intraoperative event:
	* Desaturation
	* Use of CPAP
	* Delayed emergence

Post-operative care:
* Day stay unless:  
	* ⩽2 years old  
	More likely to have severe airway obstruction postoperatively.
	* Severe OSA
	* Other comorbidities
