#Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy

>Airway: Requires either a south RAE, reinforced ETT, or flexible LMA. <br>
>Access: 22G-18G, depending on  age.<br>
>Pain: Moderate. <br>
>Position: Supine, head elevated with neck extended. <br>
>Time: 30-60min. <br>
>Blood loss: Usually minimal. May be difficult to estimate if blood enters stomach.<br>
>Special: Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis are usually not required. <br>

*This covers anaesthesia for elective tonsillectomy. Anaesthetic management of the bleeding tonsil is [covered elsewhere](/anaesthesia/ent/bleeding-tonsil.md).*


Removal of tonsils and adenoids. Performed for either:
* Chronic infection  
Usually appropriate for day-surgery provided oral intake is tolerated post-operatively.
* OSA

##Considerations
* A
	* Risk of difficult mask ventilation and intubation
* B
	* Presence and severity of OSA will affect:
		* Sensitivity to opioids and sedatives  
		Generally **avoid premedication** in paediatric cohort.
		* Post-operative destination  
		* Awake vs. deep extubation
* G
	* PONV prevention
* H
	* Coagulopathy

##Preoperative Assessment
Should cover:
* Indication for surgery
* Discussion with surgeon about preferred airway

##Preparation
##Induction
Strategies include:
* Gas induction  
Common in children.
* Intubation
	* Careful laryngoscopy to avoid bleeding from enlarged tonsils and adenoids
* Laryngeal mask  
Reduced incidence of post-extubation complications.

##Intraoperative
Maintenance with:
* Propofol/remifentanil  
Smooth haemodynamics and emergence.

###Surgical Stages
* Positioning
* Insertion of mouth gag  
	* May **compress ETT** if not using a reinforced tube
	* Highly stimulating
	* May dislodge ETT
* Adenoidectomy  
If performed, will be removed with a curette.
* Packing of nasopharynx
* Tonsillectomy
	* Superior pole drawn medially
	* Dissected from the tonsillar pillar and removed
* Haemostasis  


##Postoperative
Emergence is **critical**:
* **Remove throat pack**  
If used. Suction stomach if not used.
* **Careful suctioning**  
Under vision.
* Consider **deep extubation**
	* Most suitable in small children
	* Place left lateral, head-down  
	Leave until fully awake.
* Avoid coughing
