#Jet Ventilation

Jet ventilation:
* May be manual/low frequency or automated/high frequency  
Automated (HFJV) has reduced barotrauma compared to manual jet ventilation.
* Requires:
	* Close communication with surgeon  
	Jet fired between laser pulses to prevent cord movement.
	* Paralysis
	* Careful control of **FiO<sub>2</sub>**  
		* No laser: 100% O<sub>2</sub>
		* Laser: 30% O<sub>2</sub>  
		Consider increasing FiO<sub>2</sub> between pulses or whilst waiting for biopsy results, etc.



##High Frequency Jet Ventilators
* Deliver heated, humidified gas jets in a square wave at 1-10Hz
* Clinician can control driving pressure, frequency, inspiratory time, and composition of gas
* Have alarms and emergency shutdown devices in presence of high airway pressures
* Requires TIVA


Advantages:
* Minimises vocal cord, bronchial, and mediastinal excursion
* Can be passed through surgical field to jet into trachea
* Less haemodynamic impact compared with IPPV
* CO can be augmented using ECG synchronisation
* Avoids potential for ETT fire


Initial Setup:
* Driving pressure: 2 bar  
1-3 bar acceptable range.
* Frequency: 200/min  
150-300cpm. Increasing frequency **reduces** tidal volume.
* FiO2: 1.0
* I-time: 20%  
Adjust 20-70%. Increasing IT increases tidal volume.
* Pause pressure: 2mbar  
10-40mbar. This is the pressure measured at the tip of the ventilation catheter ~1ms before the next jet.


Adjustment:
* Increasing oxygenation and ventilation requires increasing pressure, not rate


Intraoperative Management:
* Check for movements of the chest and abdomen
* Check CO<sub>2</sub> if sampling port connected  
Not an accurate assessment of arterial CO<sub>2</sub>, and is easily lost if the port is blocked or kinked.
* Turn off HFJV prior to removing catheter to prevent contamination


##Techniques
> Supraglottic ventilation usually required for posterior cord lesions.


Supraglottic:  
* Jet kept in glottis and gas jetted through the glottis
* Pros:
	* Cheap
	* No tube in surgical field
* Cons:
	* No CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring
	* Cannot use volatile
	* Barotrauma  
	Pneumothorax.
	* Inadequate ventilation  
	If aim is incorrect. Monitor:
		* Sound
		* Chest movement
	* Movement of surgical field  
	Can't ventilate whilst lasering.
	* Malignancy  
	Theoretical risk of spreading tumour cells.
	* Risk of airborne contamination if **papilloma**; wear masks


##Complications
* **Barotrauma**  
May lead to subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum
	* Occurs due to:
		* Excessive inspiratory pressures
		* Outflow obstruction
* Hyperoxia
* Hypercapnoea
* Airway fire
