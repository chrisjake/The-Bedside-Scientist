#Principles of Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery

>ENT surgery has the anaesthetist and surgeon sharing the airway. Anaesthetic management has to adapt to surgical concerns.

Anaesthesia for ENT surgery requires:
* Understanding the **pathology**  
**Pathology determines** the:
	* Surgical approach and technique  
	This dictates the:
		* Potential options for **airway management**  
		Anaesthetic techniques has to facilitate surgery.
		* Surgical requirements
			* Laser  
			See [laser safety](/anaesthesia/considerations/laser-safety.md).
			* Head motion/position
			* Use of **nerve monitoring**  
			Requires avoidance of muscle relaxation.
			* Airway access  
			Often airway is inaccessible during surgery.
	* Likelihood of difficult airway  
	Airway compromise is common in these patients.
* Good **analgesia** plan  
Surgery may often be highly stimulating intraoperatively, but post-operative pain may be minimal.
	* High dose fentanyl for major ENT surgery
	* Remifentanil for procedures with low post-operative pain  
	0.5-1μg/kg load, and infusion at 0.1-0.3μg/kg/min.
* **Smooth emergence**  
Straining or coughing during emergence can increase bleeding, disrupt repairs, or dislodge grafts.
	* Deep extubation if appropriate
	* Exchange to LMA
	* Remifentanil at 0.1μg/kg/min
* Careful **preoperative assessment**
	* History
		* Vocal changes  
		Suggests a glottic lesion.
		* Pain
			* Ear  
			Suggests supraglottic.
		* Dysphagia  
		Suggests increased size.
	* Examination
	* Investigations
		* Nasoendoscopy
		* CXR
		* CT/MRI
		* Ultrasound
		* ABG
		* LFTs



##Pathology
Glottic Lesions:
* Location
	* Anterior  
	Usually amenable to ETT if tracheal inspection not required.
	* Posterior  
	Not amenable to ETT, requires either jet or apnoeic oxygenation.
* Type of pathology
	* Papilloma
		* Laser
		* Usually requires surgeon to inspect the entire bronchial tree
* Surgical technique
* State of airway on completion of surgery  
Often worse:
	* Blood
	* Oedema


Subglottic Lesion:
* Location
	* Amenability to tracheostomy
	* Extent of lesion
* Airway usually improved on completion of surgery


Supraglottic Lesion:
* Often straightforward larynx but view impeded by pathology  
Often need some alternative device:
	* VL
	* FOI
	* Role of awake tracheostomy
* Imaging
* Nasendoscopy
* Method of surgical treatment
* State of airway on completion of surgery

##Anaesthetic Techniques
Include:
* Tube


###Tube
Options include:
* ETT
* MLT
* Monjet
* Laser-resistant

###Tubeless:
Apnoea:
* HFNO


Spontaneous respiration:
* Propofol infusion and HFNO
* Technically difficult to achieve
* Hypercapnoea will occur and may be problematic in long cases
* Avoid in:
	* Hypertensive patients
	* Obese patients
	* Unwell patients 

	

###Insufflation
Supraglottic:  
* Jet kept in glottis and gas jetted through the glottis
* Paralysed patient
* Pros:
	* Cheap
	* No tube in surgical field
* Cons:
	* No CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring
	* Cannot use volatile
	* Barotrauma
	* Inadequate ventilation  
	If aim is incorrect. Monitor:
		* Sound
		* Chest movement
	* Movement of surgical field  
	Can't ventilate whilst lasering.
	* Malignancy  
	Theoretical risk of spreading tumour cells.


Intratracheal:
* Barotrauma
* Inadequate ventilation
* Cons:
	* Expensive tube
	* Tube in surgical field


###Tracheostomy
Awake tracheostomy in:
* Critical upper airway obstruction
	* Often time critical
	* Careful assessment
		* Patient
		* Investigation
	* Second pair of hands
		* ENT surgeon
	* Full range of equipment
	* Consider tracheostomy under LA
	* **Maintain** spontaneous respiration
* Predicted difficult intubation
* Failed intubation
* Predicted difficult extubation
* Failed extubation


###High frequency ventilation
