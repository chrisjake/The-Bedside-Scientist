#Principles of Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery

>ENT surgery has the anaesthetist and surgeon sharing the airway. Anaesthetic management has to adapt to surgical concerns.

Anaesthesia for ENT surgery requires understanding surgical requirements for:
* **Airway management**
	* Difficult airway  
	Airway compromise is common in these patients.
	* Preferred airway device for surgery  
	RAE vs reinforced ETT vs flexible LMA..
	* Surgical requirements
		* Head motion
		* Use of laser
		* Use of fibreoptic bronchoscope
	* Airway access  
	Often airway is inaccessible during surgery - strongly consider intubation.
* Use of nerve monitoring  
Requires avoidance of muscle relaxation.
* **Analgesia**  
Surgery may often be highly stimulating intraoperatively, but post-operative pain may be minimal.
	* High dose fentanyl for major ENT surgery
	* Remifentanil for procedures with low post-operative pain  
	0.5-1μg/kg load, and infusion at 0.1-0.3μg/kg/min.
* **Smooth emergence**  
Straining or coughing during emergence can increase bleeding, disrupt repairs, or dislodge grafts.
	* Deep extubation if appropriate
	* Exchange to LMA
	* Remifentanil at 0.1μg/kg/min
