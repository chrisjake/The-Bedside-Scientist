#Obstetric Terms

*This section covers obstetric terms, procedures, acronyms, and conditions which are too small to have their own page, but are of relevance to the practice of obstetric anaesthesia and critical care.*

##Abortion - AB
Usually understood by patients to refer to an **elective** termination of pregnancy. Non-elective abortions are covered under [miscarriage](#mis)

##Anteflexed - AF
*See [anteverted](#anteverted).

##Amniotic Fluid Index - AFI {#afi}
Estimate of uterine amniotic fluid volume:
* Indicator of foetal well-being.
* Normal is 5-25cm
	* Begins to reduce after 35/40
	* [Oligohydramnios](#oligo) is < 5cm
	* [Polyhydramnios](#poly) is >25cm

##Alpha-foetal protein - AFP
Maternal blood test used to evaluate for presence of foetal birth defects. AFP is:
* Produced in foetal liver
* Elevated in:
	* Neural tube defects
	* Abdominal wall defects
	* Abnormal placentation

##Advanced Maternal Age - AMA
Pregnancy in woman over 35. Associated with increased risk of obstetric complications, including:
* Placental abruption
* Placenta praevia
* Malposition
* Low Birth Weight
* Preterm Delivery
* Post-dates delivery
* PPH
* Requirement for IVF
	* Subsequent increased risk of multiple pregnancy (due to IVF) amplifies some of the above risks

##Artificial Rupture of Membranes - AROM {#arom}
Deliberate breaking of amniotic membranes surrounding foetus. AROM:
* Also known as amniotomy
* Indications include:
	* Induce or augment labour  
	With or without oxytocin infusion.
	* Perform foetal measurements
		* Apply foetal scalp electrode
		* Measure foetal lactate/pH
	* Assess composition of liquor in presence of abnormal [FHR](#fhr)
* Benefits:
	* Reduced length of labour
	* Reduced oxytocin requirement  
	For augmented labour.
	* Allow liquor assessment
* Complications:
	* Cord prolapse
	* Rupture of vasa praevia
	* Infection  
	Proportional to number of subsequent VE's.
	* Pain


##Anteverted - AV{#anteverted}
Normal anterior flexion of uterus over bladder.

##Biparietal Diameter - BPD
Ultrasonographic measurement of foetal head width, used to produce an estimate of foetal weight and subsequently gestational age.

##Bilateral Salpingo-oophorectomy - BSO
Removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes.

##Biophysical Profile - BPP
Prenatal ultrasound evaluation of foetal well-being. Evaluates:
* [FHR](#FHR)
* Foetal Breathing
* Foetal Movement
* Foetal Tone
* [AFI](#afi)

##Beat-to-beat varibility - BTBV
Short-term variability in foetal heart rate.

##Bilateral Tubal Ligation - BTL ("Beetle")
Permanent technique for female sterilisation.

##Breech Presentation {#breech}
Where the [presenting part](#pp) is the bottom or feet. Breech presentations are:
* Sometimes able to be converted to a cephalic presentation with [ECV](#ecv)
* Safest delivered via caesarian section
* Subdivided into:
	* Frank (extended) breech  
	Feet are next to ears with hips flexed and knees extended.
	* Complete (flexed) breech  
	Foetus is cross-legged.
	* Footling breech  
	One or both feet are the presenting part.

##Cephalopelvic Disproportion - CPD
Mismatch between size of foetal head and maternal pelvis. Results in obstructed labour due to mechanical failure to progress, and commonly leads to caesarian section.

##Cord Prolapse
Prolapse of umbilical cord through an open cervix in advance of the [presenting part](#pp). Cord prolapse:
* May lead to rapid foetal ischaemia and death - this is an **obstetric emergency** 
Requires rapid intervention and commonly operative delivery. Broadly, management consists of:
	* Minimising cord impingement
		* Replacing cord into vagina
		* Elevating the presenting part  
		* Tocolysis
	* Assisted vaginal birth may be considered if cervix is dilated and presenting part is engaged
	* Emergency [caesarian section](/anaesthesia/obs/luscs.md) is required if foetus is viable and unable to deliver vaginally.
* Occurs in 0.2-0.4% of births  
About half are iatrogenic, due to:
	* [AROM](#arom)
	* [ECV](#ecv)
	* Insertion of intrauterine pressure monitor
* Risk factors include:
	* Malpresentation
	* LBW
	* Multiple pregnancy
	* Multiparity
	* [Polyhydramnios](#poly)
	* Prematurity
	* Pelvic tumours
	* Abnormally long umbilical cord
* Differs from:
	* Umbilical cord presentation  
	Umbilical cord lies in front of the presenting part, but the membranes are intact.
	* Occult umbilical cord prolapse  
	Cord lies trapped beside the presenting part.

##Cartiotocograph - CTG
Electronic measurement of foetal heart rate and uterine tone.

##Dilation
First stage of labour is defined by extent (in cm) of cervical dilation, and is divided into:
* Latent phase  
Softening and shortening of cervix. Occurs from 0-3cm.
* Active phase  
Active labour from 3-10cm. Contractions become more active and dilation continues at 0.5-1cm/hr.

##External Cephalic Version - ECV {#ecv}
External rotation of foetus in the womb to a cephalic presentation. ECG is:
* Associated with risks of:
	* ROM
	* APH
	* Failure
* Contraindicated when:
	* Caesarian section required for other reasons
	* APH occurred in last 7/7
	* CTG is abnormal
	* Major uterine abnormality
	* ROM
	* Multiple presentation

##External Foetal Monitoring - EFM
*See [CTG].

##Estimated Gestational Age - EGA
Measure of age of pregnancy in weeks, i.e. x/40. May be calculated from:
* Days since last menstrual period
* Size of foetus on early obstetric ultrasound
* Days since oocyte retrieval (if IVF)

##Group B Strep - GBS
Bacteria which commonly colonises maternal vagina. GBS colonisation:
* Increases risk of:
	* Preterm labour
	* PROM
	* Chorioamnionitis
	* Neonatal infection  
	5% mortality from:
		* Pneumonia
		* Sepsis
		* Meningitis
* Identified with routine antenatal culture
* Treated with IV antibiotics during labour

##Gestational diabetes - GDM
Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy. GDM:
* Occurs in ~10% of Australian Pregnancies
* Usually resolves following the pregnancy
* Increases risks of:
	* Pre-eclapsia
	* HTN
	* Premature labour
	* Macrosomia
	* IUGR
	* Caesarian section
* Treatment includes:
	* Insulin  
	First line treatment as it does not cross the placenta.
	


##Gravida and Parity
Summary of obstetric history:
* Gravida  
Number of pregnancies. NB:
	* Includes curent pregnancy
	* A twin pregnancy counts as 1
* Parity  
Pregnancy carried to >20 weeks.
