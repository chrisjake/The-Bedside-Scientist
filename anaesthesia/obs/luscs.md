#Caesarean Section {#id}

##Anaesthetic Technique
May be either:
* Single-shot spinal  
Lowest morbidity and mortality technique. >90% of LUSCS are performed under spinal.
* Epidural top-up
* GA

###Spinal
* Patient should be consented that:
	* Spinal does not remove all sensation
	* Discomfort will be felt at certain points
		* Pull prior to uterine incisoin
		* Upper abdominal pressure to deliver baby

* Head down position may assist block to spread cranially
* Block to ice at T4 required bilaterally

####Complications in LUSCS
* Inadequate blockade
	* Pain  
	Due to no block of high thoracic dermatomes.
		* Additional analgesia required in up to 5%  
		Options include:
			* Nitrous oxide
			* Intravenous opioid  
			Alert paediatrics if this is given prior to delivery.
				* Alfentanil
				* Fentanyl
	* Conversion to GA  
	Due to significant pain.
		* Occurs in 2%


###Epidural Top-up

####Complications in LUSCS
* Inadequate blockade
	* Pain
		* Additional analgesia required in 15%
	* Alternate technique required in 10%


###General Anaesthesia

###Complications in LUSCS
* Awareness  
High risk in obstetric population, and especially LUSCS:
	* Occurs in ~1/670
	* Multifactorial:
		* High CO  
			* Increased onset/offset of IV agents
			* Decreased onset/offset of volatile agents
		* No premedication
		* Rapid onset of surgical stimulation following induction
		* Increased V<sub>D</sub>
	* 20% risk of new psychological morbidity following an awareness event


* Failed intubation  
Higher risk in obstetric population.
	* Occurs in ~1/300
	* Anatomical changes
		* Laryngeal oedema
		* Increased breast size
		* Decreased safe apnoea time
			* Increased VO<sub>2</sub>
			* Decreased FRC


* Aspiration  
Increased risk in obstetric population.
	* Occurs in 0.15% of obstetric GAs with unsecured airways
	* 25mls of gastric contents may cause pulmonary complicaitons
	* Multifactorial:
		* Lower gastric pH
		* Increased gastric volume
	* Antacid prophylaxis
