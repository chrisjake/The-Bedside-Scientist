Caesarian section can be performed:
* At different degrees of urgency  
Divided into 4 categories:
	* Cat 1  
	Imminent threat to life of mother or foetus.
		* Objective is to deliver baby as rapidly as possible whilst being safe  
		GA is often used.
	* Cat 2  
	Maternal or foetal compromise that is not imminently life threatening.
	* Cat 3  
	No compromise, but requires early delivery.
	* Cat 4  
	No compromise, delivery timed to suit the mother and the hospital.
* With a different techniques
	* **GA**  
		* Quick to perform and reliable
		* Allows fastest delivery of baby
		* Increased risk:
			* Anaphylaxis
			* Aspiration
			* Increased blood loss  
			Without increased transfusion requirement.
		* Indications:
			* Maternal request
			* Cat 1 CS  
			In skilled hands with good patient selection a spinal or epidural top-up is also appropriate.
			* Contraindication to regional technique
			* Failure of regional technique
			* Additional surgery required
	* **Regional**  
	Desired **block level is T4-S4** to light touch and ice.
		* Many advantages over GA:
			* Mother and support person can be present at delivery
			* Lower risk  
			Predominantly due to less aspiration.
			* Alert neonate  
			Early bonding and breastfeeding.
			* Better postoperative analgesia and mobilisation
		* **Spinal**  
		Most (>90%) CS are performed under spinal.
			* Rapid onset
			* Simple (usually)
			* < 1% failure rate
			* More rapid sympathectomy than epidural, leading to greater haemodynamic disturbance  
			Can be avoided with use of phenylephrine infusion.
			* Shorter acting, and difficult to correct  
			Avoid if procedure is expected to be >2 hours in duration.
		* **Epidural top-up**  
			* Used when a working epidural is already present  
			Easy to top up.
			* Greater haemodynamic stability at cost of slower onset
			* Generally poorer block than spinal
			* Additional top-up can be given intraoperatively
			* Epidural can be used for post-operative analgesia
		* **CSE**
			* Technically more difficult
			* Greater haemodynamic stability
			* Allows block to be extended if surgery is prolonged
			* Epidural can be used for post-operative analgesia

##Considerations
* A
	* Higher risk of difficult airway
	* High risk aspiration
* B
	* Reduced FRC and increased VO<sub>2</sub> in pregnancy lead to faster desaturation
	* Respiratory function may be compromised with regional techniques
* C
	* HDx state may be compromised with regional techniques
* D
	* Anxiety
		* Often first exposure many people have to the hospital system  
		Aim to make it a positive one.
		* Regional and neuraxial anaesthesia are anxiety-inducing
* G
	* Antacid prophylaxis
* H
	* Group and Hold  
	There is always a risk of massive haemorrhage with obstetric cases.
* O
	* Diseases of pregnancy
	* Placenta position  
	Low-lying anterior placenta greatly increases risk of major haemorrhage, especially if there is a scar from previous CS.

##Preoperative Assessment
Specific factors include:
* Gestational history
	* Previous CS and issues
* Issues with current pregnancy
	* Pre-eclampsia
	* Placenta position
* Expected operative duration


###Indications for Antenatal Anaesthetics Review
* A
	* Previous airway issues
* B
	* Poorly controlled asthma
	* Respiratory disease that impairs ADLs
* C
	* Valvular disease
	* Arrhythmias
	* Congenital cardiac disease
	* PPM/ICD
	* Pulmonary hypretension
* D
	* Chronic pain
	* Intracranial lesions
	* Neuromuscular disease
	* Spinal anatomy disease that may limit neuraxial options
* E
	* Morbid Obesity
	* History of MH
* H
	* Coagulopathy
	* Thrombocytopaenia
	* Refusal for blood products


##Preparation{#prep}
* Give antacid prophylaxis
	* Ranitidine 150mg PO  
	2 hours prior to surgery.
	* 30ml sodium citrate  
	Immediately prior.
* Standard ANZCA monitoring  
Cycle BP cuff minutely from induction until delivery.
	* Treat hypotension aggressively with vasopressor  
	Treat nausea aggressively with vasopressor, as this is often a sign of hypotension.
* Give supplemental oxygen if <95% on air
* Wedge  
Under right hip to displace the gravid uterus off the IVC, and ensure venous return.
* Large IVC  
16G or bigger ideal, 18G acceptable.
* Volume load  
Up to 10ml/kg of crystalloid.
* Start phenylephrine infusion on commencement of anaesthesia, aiming to preserve the baseline BP  
Generally 30-60ml/hr of 100ug/ml of phenylephrine.
	* Adjust infusion rate each minute depending on the blood pressure  
	25-50% increments are reasonable.
	* Phenylephrine is the preferred agent as it does not constrict the spiral arteries
	* 100μg bolus can be used to treat hypotension
* Ensure oxytocin available
* Prophylactic antibiotics  
Should be given prior to skin incision.


##Induction
Induction varies on anaesthetic technique used:


###Template for GA CS
* Preoxygenate
* Surgeons scrubbed
* Abdomen prepped and draped
* Perform RSI  
Ensure adequate doses induction agent and relaxant.
	* Thiopentone 5-7mg/kg
	* Propofol is associated with poorer neonatal status
	* Suxamethonium 1-2mg/kg  
	Additional relaxation should not be required, but as only trivial amounts of NMBD cross the placenta and extra can be given without concern for foetal effects if required.
	* Alfentanil  
	Reasonable in patients with severe cardiac disease or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
* Intubate  
A slightly smaller tube may make intubation easier and will be adequate to ventilate with.
* Commence ventilation
	* 50% O<sub>2</sub>/50% N<sub>2</sub>O  
	MAC-sparing, thereby reducing tocolytic effects of volatile agent.
	* Over-pressure volatile  
	Target >0.8 MAC.
* Aim low-nomral CO<sub>2</sub>
* At delivery
	* Give analgesia  
	Opioid, paracetamol, NSAID.
		* Opioids administered before delivery may cause foetal depression  
		Alert paediatrics if this occurs.
	* (Give oxytocin as well, as per obstetrician request)
	* Increase FiN<sub>2</sub>O to 0.67 and reduce volatile  
	Decrease tocolysis, aiming to decrease uterine bleeding.
		* Can consider use of additional IV agents (e.g. midazolam) to further reduce MAC and volatile requirements
* Consider regional analgesia
	* TAP block
	* Rectus sheath catheters.
* Extubate awake


###Template for Spinal for CS
* Discuss with patient that
	* Spinal does not remove all sensation
	* Discomfort will be felt at certain points
		* Pull prior to uterine incisoin
		* Upper abdominal pressure to deliver baby
* Sitting position preferred if patient will tolerate this
* Premedication is acceptable for anxiolysis
	* Midazolam 0.02mg/kg
* Perform spinal  
Many different options:
	* 2.2ml of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine and 15μg of fentanyl is a reliable combination for most patients
	* Bupivacaine 8-12mg  
	Block will recede after 1.5 hours, though some block will remain after 2.5 hours.
		* Hyperbaric bupivacaine has a more rapid onset and the level can be adjusted by moving the table
	* Lignocaine generally avoided because of transient neurological symptoms
	* Ropivacaine has a much shorter intrathecal duration of action
	* Opioids  
	May be added to improve analgesia intra- and post-operatively.
		* Fentanyl 10-25μg
		* Morphine 50-150μg  
		Provides longer lasting analgesia in exchange for risks of PONV, pruritis (can be severe), and late respiratory depression.

* Lie supine with pillow
	* Trendelenburg can be used to increase the cranial spread
	* Reverse trendelenburg will reduce cranial spread   
	Increase the degree of tilt if block is rising/rises too cranially.
* Place wedge
* Commence phenylephrine infusion
* Test the block
	* No block  
		* Consider repeat spinal  
		May cause exaggerated haemodynamic response.
		* Consider GA
	* Inadequate block  
	Consider epidural and slow titration of LA.


###Template for Epidural Top-Up for CS{#etu}
* Test the current block  
* Incrementally top up epidural
	* 2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 of adrenaline  
	5ml bolus Q2-3 min, up to 7mg/kg.
	* 0.5% bupivacaine/levobupivacaine/ropivacaine  
	5ml bolus Q4-5min up to 2mg/kg.
	* Additional opioid  
	e.g. 100μg fentanyl.
* Test the block  
	* No block  
	Catheter may be inadequately positioned. Consider:
		* Resiting epidural
		* Peforming spinal
	* Inadequate block  
	Epidural may be resited or withdrawn.
		* Consider
			* Further top-up  
			Ensure that further top-ups will not prohibit performing a spinal if required.
			* Spinal
		* If LA dose limit has been reached:
			* Consider abandoning  
			For elective procedures.
			* Convert to GA  
			For emergency procedures.


###Template for CSE for CS
* Sit patient up
* Perform CSE  
Can be performed as:
	* Needle-through-needle technique
	* Two-needle technique
* Dosing
	* Most cases given a full-dose spinal with subsequent epidural top-up if required
	In addition to top up with LA, 10mls 0.9% NaCl can be given through the epidural to compress the dural sac and encourage cranial spread of intrathecal LA.
	* Can alternatively give a half-dose spinal, followed by intentional titration  
	More haemodynamically stable, and confirms adequate positioning of epidural.
* Test the block  
As per [epidural top-up](#etu).


##Intraoperative
This section is divided into:
* Surgical stages
* General complications of CS
* Complications of regional techniques in CS
* Complications of GA in CS


###Surgical Stages
* Test block
* Laparotomy
* Peritoneal retraction
* Uterine incision  
If amnion is intact then amniotic fluid will enter abdominal cavity.
* 

###General Complications of CS
* Massive haemorrhage
* Amniotic fluid embolism
* Post-partum haemorrhage  
Typically due to poor tone.
	* Uterine massage
	* Oxytocin

###Complications of Regional Techniques in CS
* Bradycardia
	* May be due to vena cava compression or blockade of cardioaccelerator fibres
	* Should be treated if <50 and associated with hypotension
	* 200-400ug glycopyrrolate is the preferred agent  
	Does not cross placenta.


* Nausea and vomiting  
	* Predominantly due to hypotension
	* May be due to visceral manipulation or rapid administration of oxytocic  
	Amenable to vasopressors.


* Hypotension  
	* First line treatment should be pressor agents  
	Adjust phenylephrine infusions, covered [here](#prep).


* Inadequate blockade
	* Pain  
		* Generally due to no block of high thoracic dermatomes.
		* Alternate technique required in up to 10%
		* Additional analgesia required in up to 15%  
		Options include:
			* Reassurance
			* Epidural top-up (if available)
			* Nitrous oxide
			* IV opioid  
			Alert paediatrics if this is given prior to delivery. Short acting agents preferred:
				* Alfentanil
				* Fentanyl
			* Conversion to GA  
				* Generally comply with this if the patient requests it and risk is not extreme
				* Often required if pain occurs before foetal delivery
				* Occurs in 2%


* High spinal



###Complications of GA in CS
* Awareness  
High risk in obstetric population, and especially CS:
	* Occurs in ~1/670
	* Multifactorial:
		* High CO  
			* Increased onset/offset of IV agents
			* Decreased onset/offset of volatile agents
		* No premedication
		* Rapid onset of surgical stimulation following induction
		* Increased V<sub>D</sub>
	* 20% risk of new psychological morbidity following an awareness event


* Failed intubation  
Higher risk in obstetric population.
	* Occurs in ~1/300
	* Major cause of death in obstetric population
	* Anatomical changes
		* Laryngeal oedema
		* Increased breast size
		* Decreased safe apnoea time
			* Increased VO<sub>2</sub>
			* Decreased FRC


* Aspiration  
Increased risk in obstetric population.
	* Major cause of death in obstetric population
	* Occurs in 0.15% of obstetric GAs with unsecured airways
	* 25mls of gastric contents may cause pulmonary complications
	* Multifactorial:
		* Lower gastric pH
		* Increased gastric volume

##Postoperative
Most departments have a standard post-operative analgesia management protocol. These include:
* PO-only:
	* Paracetamol 1g QID
	* Ibuprofen 400mg TDS
	* Oxycontin 20mg BD
	* Coloxyl + Senna ii BD
	* Endone 5-10mg Q2H PRN
	* Ondansetron 4-8mg IV TDS PRN
