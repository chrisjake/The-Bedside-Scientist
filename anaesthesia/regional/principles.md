#Principles of Regional Anaesthesia

*This section covers aspects common to peripheral nerve blockade.*

This section is divided into:
* The 'block time out'
* Procedural techniques
* Delivery mechanisms
* LA dosing
* Complications and risk-reduction methods

##Block Time-Out {#timeout}
Prior to performing a regional block:
* Verify the **side** and **site** of proposed block with another clinician  
Requires:
	* Patient identification
	* Checking of the surgical consent
	* Identificaiton of a surgical site mark
	* Discussion with the patient if possible
	* Placement of a mark close enough to the block site to be visible whilst performing the block
	* **Pausing *just*** prior to needle insertion to:
		* Verify presence of side and site mark
		* Verbally confirm site with the assistant

##Procedural Techniques
Can use:
* Landmark only
* Nerve stimulator
* Ultrasound


###Landmark
###Ultrasound
* Gold standard
* Associated with reduced rate of vascular injury compared to stimulator
	* Identify vessels on proposed needle path and choose approach to avoid them
* Approach:
	* Halt needle advancement prior to encountering nerve
	* Aim off
* **Tips for optimising success**:
	* Place digital pressure on the needle insertion site  
	Allows insertion site to be used as a fulcrum and torque the needle to drastically change direction after having penetrated a muscle plane.
	* Penetrate fascial planes away from nerves/vesseels, then slide up within that plane
	* Injection inside the nerve *sheath* causes a rapid onset of surgical anaesthesia, but increases the risk of nerve injury

###Stimulator
* Allows localisation of nerves via electrical stimulation
* Stimulate:
	* At 1mA until muscle contractions visible in that nere area
	* Reduce current to 0.3-0.5mA/0.1ms prior to injection
* Consider giving a 0.5ml saline injection (Raj test)  
Should be associated with a loss of motor response.

Troubleshooting:
* Battery charged
* Wires are connected
* ECG electrode has good electrical contact
* Ensure landmarks correct


##Delivery Mechanisms
Can use:
* Single-shot
* Catheter

###Single-Shot
###Catheter for Continuous Infusion
* Prepare skin carefully  
Ensure catheter is not contaminated by alcohol solutions (neurotoxic).
* Inject small bolus of LA prior to inserting catheter  
Hydrodissect space for catheter.
* Pass catheter 2-5cm past needle tip
* Remove needle  
Ensure catheter position does not change.
* Inject remainder of loading dose into catheter

Postoperative management:
* Unambiguous labelling of the giving set
	* Tubing colour should be unique to regional analgesia infusions
	* Infusion pumps should be unique to regional analgesia
* Regular monitoring of physiological parameters and pain
* Ideally daily review by the proceduralist or a trained delegate
* Continue LA delivery:
	* Constant infusion at 2-10ml/h
	* Background infusion of 2ml/h with 5ml Q30min boluses PRN
* May be left in for 3-5 days


Troubleshooting:
* Ensure catheter is positioned correctly/not dislodged
* Consider bolus (e.g. 10ml 0.2% ropivacaine) if only partial analgesia present


##Dosing
**Single-shot:**
||Lignocaine|Bupivacaine|Ropivacaine|
|--|--|
|**Concentration**|1-2%|0.25-0.5%|0.5-1%|
|**Dose**|< 4mg/kg|< 2mg/kg|< 3mg/kg|
|**Time to Onset**|5-15 minutes|10-25 minutes|10-25 minutes|
|**Duration**|2-5 hours|Up to 12 hours|Up to 12 hours|


**Continuous Infusion:**
||Bupivacaine|Ropivacaine|
|--|--|
|**Concentration**|0.125-0.25%|0.2%|
|**Maximum Dose Rate**|Up to 18.75mg/hr|Up to 28mg/hr|

##Complications
* Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST)
	* Occurs in ~1/1,000-1/10,000 regional techniques
		* Cardiac arrest in ~1/25,000
	* Techniques to avoid LAST:
		* Aspirate repeatedly
		* Inject LA in discrete boluses
		* Ensure good spread of LA on ultrasound
		* Inject slowly

* Vascular injury
	* Haematoma  
	May lead to compression and secondary injury.
	* Techniques to avoid vascular injury:
		* Identify vessels prior to injection
		* Choose a needle path that minmises peri-vascular approach
		* Compress veins during needle passage (after they have been identified)
	* **Management of anticoagulants**  
	Peripheral nerve blocks are low risk for serious bleeding. *In general* (and **in absence of other risk factors**; such as age, renal/hepatic disease, history of major bleeding):
		* Aspirin and NSAIDs do not need to be discontinued  
		* P2Y12 inhibits do not need to be discontinued  
		Includes clopidogrel, ticagreular, prasugrel.
		* Warfarin may safely be continued if INR < 3.0  
		Cessation should be discussed with treating team.
		* UFH should be ceased at least 4 hours before the procedure, and restarted 2 hours after
		* Prophylactic-dose LMWH should be last given at least 12 hours prior
		* Therapeutic-dose LMWH should be last given at least 24 hours prior
		* NOACs may be safely continued  
		Cessation should be discussed with the treating team, and at least 2 drug half-lifes should occur between cessation and intervention.


* Nerve injury
	* ~2-4/10,000 blocks
	* Not reduced with ultrasound guidance
	* Deficits:
		* Predominantly sensory  
		Paraethesias.
		* Typically resolve in less than a month:
			* 92% resolve in 1 month
			* 96% in 3 months
			* > 99% in 6 months
	* Risk factors
		* Intraneural injection  
		Injection of LA should be performed outside of the connective tissue sheath of the nerve, in the plane of cleavage between epineurium and the extraneural connective tissue layers.
			* Should be a low-pressure, hydrodissection of the space
			* Intraneural injection may be identified as nerve expansion under ultrasound
	* Techniques to avoid nerve injury:
		* Avoid paresthesiae
		* Use atraumatic needle


* Infection
	* Risk is increased with use of continuous catheters versus single-shot techniques  
	Catheters should be placed under strict asepsis.


* Block-specific complications  
Covered in detail under specific blocks; examples include phrenic nerve block after performing a supraclavicular brachial pleuxus block.
