#Principles of Regional Anaesthesia

*This section covers aspects common to peripheral nerve blockade*

##Techniques
###Landmark
###Ultrasound
* Gold standard
* Associated with reduced rate of vascular injury compared to stimulator
	* Identify vessels on proposed needle path and choose approach to avoid them

###Stimulator


##Complications
* Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST)
* Vascular injury
	* Haematoma  
	May lead to compression and secondary injury.
* Nerve injury
	* ~2-4/10,000 blocks
	* Not reduced with ultrasound guidance
	* Deficits:
		* Predominantly sensory  
		Paraethesias.
		* Typically resolve in less than a month:
			* 92% resolve in 1 month
			* 96% in 3 months
			* > 99% in 6 months
