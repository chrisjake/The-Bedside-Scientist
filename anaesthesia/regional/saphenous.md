#Saphenous Nerve Block
The saphenous nerve is the terminal sensory branch of the femoral nerve. Blockade:
* Provides analgesia to variable strip of medial leg, foot, and ankle  
May also cause local motor block to vastus medialus.
* May facilitate superficial procedures
* Usually supplements a sciatic block when performing foot and ankle procedures

##Indications
Anaesthesia for lower leg in combination with sciatic nerve block.


##Contraindications
* General contraindications:
	* Patient refusal
	* LA allergy
	* Local infection

##Anatomy
The saphenous nerve:
* Lies in the adductor canal, close to the femoral artery and vein  
Deep to sartorius and superficial to vastus medialis.
* Typically not visible on ultrasound  
May be seen as a small, round, hyperechoic structure medial to the artery.
* Typically 2-3cm deep

##Equipment
* Standard nerve block tray
* High-frequency linear probe
* 5-10cm 22G short-bevel needle
* 5-10ml local anaesthetic

##Technique
* Position supine
* Place US probe over sartorius in the mid-thigh
* Identify sartorious  
Triangular, 'hull-shaped' muscle, with femoral artery running along the 'keel'. Saphenous nerve runs with the artery in this canal.
* Identify femoral artery  
Can scan caudally from groin if artery is not immediately identifiable.
* Standard prep, drape, skin anaesthesia, etc
* Perform block IP or OOP:
	* Aim to place needle tip just medial to femoral artery, deep to sartorius
	* Ensure good deposition of LA below sartorious, forming ring around artery

##Complications
* General complications
	* Intravascular injection
	* LAST
	* Nerve injury
	* Infection
	* Failure
	* Allergy to LA
* Specific complications
	* Motor block to vastus medialis  
	Avoid unsupported ambulation immediately post.
