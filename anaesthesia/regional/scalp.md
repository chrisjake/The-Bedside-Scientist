#Scalp Block

##Indications
* Craniotomy  
Notable awake craniotomy.
* Repair of scalp lacerations


##Contraindications
##Anatomy
Sensory supply to the scalp:
* Trigeminal nerve  
Three divisions:
	* V1 (Opthalmic)  
	Innervates forehead and anterior scalp via the frontal nerve, which divides in the orbit into the:
		* Supraorbital nerve  
		May be blocked as it exits the supraorbital foramen.
		* Supratrochlear nerve  
		Exits the supraorbital foramen and travels deep to frontalis.
	* V2 (Maxillary)  
	Innervates zygomatic arch via series of cutaneous branches.
	* V3 (Mandibular)  
	Innervates peri-auricular scalp via series of cutaneous branches.
* Cervical plexus  
	* Greater occipital nerve  
	Innervates major portion of posterior scalp via devision of C2.
	* Lesser occipital nerve  
	From posterior divisions of C2 and C3, supplies scalp posterior to the ear.

##Equipment
##Technique
Six nerves are blocked during a scalp block:
* Supraorbital nerve  
	* Identify the supraorbital notch
	* Insert needle ~1cm medial to the supraorbital notch
* Supratrochlear nerve
	* Extend the supraorbital nerve block 1cm medial to cover this nerve as it emerges from the superomedial aspect of the orbit  
	This landmark is the apex of the angle formed by the eyebrow and the nasal spine.
* Auriculotemporal nerve
	* Identify the superficial temporal artery  
	Ensure it is avoided during LA injection.
	* Inject over the zygomatic process, 1-1.5cm anterior to the ear at the level of the tragus
* Zygomaticotemporal Nerve
	* Infiltrate between the supraorbital margin to the posterior part of the zygomatic arch  
	Ensure infiltration both deep and superficial to the temporalis muscle.


* Greater occipital nerve
	* Infiltrate halfway between the occipital protuberance and the mastoid process  
	* Lies medial to the occipital artery (may be palpated)  
	Ensure negative aspiration to avoid occipital artery injection.
* Lesser occipital nerve
	* Infiltrate along the superior nuchal line


At each site:
* Inject 2-5ml of 0.25-0.5% bupivacaine

##Complications
*General complications of regional techniques are covered under [Principles of Regional Anaesthesia](/anaesthesia/regional/principles.md)*

Specific complications of the scalp block include:
* Cerebral LA toxicity  
CNS effects (including seizures) may occur with very small volumes of intra-arterial LA.
