#Sciatic Nerve Block

##Indications
Can be used:
* Analgesia for
	* Hip surgery
* Anaesthesia for
	* Foot and ankle surgery
	* Knee surgery  
	Requires concomitant femoral nerve block.

##Contraindications
##Anatomy
##Equipment
* 10-15cm needle
* Local anaesthetic
	* 20-30ml of 0.75% ropivacaine

##Technique
Indication determines level to be blocked:
* Proximal  
Hip surgery.
* Mid-thigh/bifurcation  
Knee/foot/ankle surgery.


Lateral approach:
* Position  
Can be:
	* Semi-prone  
	For all approaches.
	* Supine with hip and knee flexed  
	For mid-distal approaches.


* Place probe on posterior thigh
* Identify sciatic nerve
	* Hyperechoic
	* Large
	* Between gluteus maximus and adductor magnus
	* Posterior to femur
* Follow course of nerve to confirm nerve identify and the intended level of block
* IP approach:
	* Whilst scanning the posterior thigh, insert the needle through the lateral thigh  
	* Insert the needle anterior to the probe, such that the needle is heading directly towards the lateral edge of the nerve  
	i.e. if the nerve is 5cm deep on ultrasound, insert the needle 5cm anterior to the probe position.
* Inject 20-30ml of LA


Anterior approach:
* Position patient supine
* Use a curvilinear (low frequency) probe
* Place probe **8cm** from inguinal crease
* Identify femoral vessels and femur
* Identify sciatic nerve at the medial edge of the femur
	* Probe may need to be angled medially
* OOP approach  
Typically easier than IP approach:
	* Identification of needle may be difficult
	* Walk needle off medial edge of femur
	* Confirm needle position with
		* Stimulator
		* Jiggling
	* Inject 20-30ml of LA
