#Epidural

##Indications
* Analgesia  
    * Adjunct to major abdominal and thoracic procedures  
    In general, offers significant benefit in high-risk patients and high-risk surgery:
        * Reduces stress response
        * Reduces incidence of serious complications
        * Provides excellent analgesia

##Dosing
* Maximal epidural dosing:  
Dose reduce in hepatic failure, renal failure, or severe hypoalbuminaemia.
    * Ropivacaine 3-4mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.6 hours<sup>-1</sup>
    * Bupivacaine 2-3mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.6 hours<sup>-1</sup>


##Management of Inadequate Analgesia
Inadequate analgesia:
* Pain > 5
* Inability to cough or move effectively

Management process:
* Assess vitals
* Exclude surgical cause of pain
* Check catheter location  
Catheter may migrate out of the epidural space.
    * Check anticoagulation status prior to manipulation.
* Check BP  
Hypotension and uncorrected hypovolaemia are relative contraindications to epidural bolus.
* Epidural Rescue  
A rescue bolus of LA can be delivered to re-establish a failing epidural.
    * Ensure adequate monitoring
    * Ensure working IV access
    * Ensure vasopressor is readily available
    * Give a rescue bolus  
    The end point is either analgesia or side effects.
        * Appropriate agents include:
            * 0.25% bupivacaine  
            6-10ml is appropriate for most adult patients, though more will sometimes be required.
            * Ropivacaine 0.35%
            * Ropivacaine 0.2%
        * If analgesia is achieved:
            * Increase rate by one third
            * Change solution
        * If a unilateral block is present:
            * Pull catheter back to 3cm within the epidural space
            * Repeat bolus
        * If no block to ice is present:
            * Consider alternate methods of analgesia
