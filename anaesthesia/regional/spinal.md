#Spinal Anaesthesia

Spinal anaesthesia is:
* Performed by injecting local anaesthetic into the CSF  
Typically below where the cord ends (L2).
	* Autonomic and pain fibres are blocked first  
	Vasodilation and hypotension correspond with block.
	* Motor fibres are blocked last  
	Motor fibres also recover first.
* Generally easy to perform  
* Useful for surgery below the umbilicus
* Cheap


##Indications
Relative:
* Patient factors
	* Difficult airway  
	Airway patency is maintained.
	* Respiratory disease  
	Less respiratory impairment than GA.
	* Frailty and systemic disease  
	Spinal anaesthesia tends to be less physiologically disruptive.
* Surgical factors
	* Sub-umbilical surgery
	* Muscle relaxation  
	Good operating conditions provided.
	* Reduced blood loss


##Contraindications
*This covers contraindications specific to spinal anesthesia. General contraindications to neuraxial techniques are covered under [principles of neuraxial anaesthesia](/anaesthesia/regional/principles/principles-neuraxial.md).


* Surgical factors
	* Operative duration  
	Surgery expected to last >2 hours will usualy require a different technique.



##Preoperative Assessment
Key factors:
* C
	* Volume and haemodynamic state
* D
	* Anxiety levels
* E
	* Back anatomy
	* Presence of local infection

##Preparation
* Alert the patient that spinal anaesthesia:
	* Removes pain but some sensation may remain  
	This will be weird or uncomfortable but shouldn't be painful
	* Causes motor weakness
* Standard ANZCA monitoring  
Regular (e.g. 1 minutely) BP after spinal injection.
* 18G or greater IVC
* Vasopressor available  
Consider infusion if it is necessary to defend SBP.
* LP equipment
* Local anaesthetic  
Classically bupivacaine is used:
	* Typically lasts **2-2.5 hours**
	* Can be either:
		* Hyperbaric/heavy bupivacaine  
		Mixed with 8% dextrose. Heavy bupivacaine:
			* Provides a denser block
			* Blocks more inferior nerve roots
			* Can be adjusted by adjusting the tilt of the table  
			For a block at L3/4:
				* Sitting patients will tend to achieve an upper block height on T7-T10  
				Allows a dense saddle block to be achieved.
				* Supine patients will tend to achieve an upper block of T4-T7
			* Dosing of heavy bupivacaine
				* Adults: 2-4ml (10-20mg)
				* <5kg: 0.4-0.5mg/kg
				* 5-15kg: 0.3-0.4mg/kg
				* 15-40: 0.25-0.3mg/kg
		* Plain bupivacaine  
		Mixed with saline online. Plain bupivacaine:
			* Tends to rise slightly
			* Cannot be adjusted
			* Dosing
				* Adults: 2-3.5ml 0.5% plain bupivacaine
		* Opioid  
		Opioid may be added to prolong the duration of analgesia and reduce the dose of LA required, at the risk of respiratory depression. Dosing:
			* Fentanyl 10-25ug  
			Lasts 1-4 hours.
			* Morphine 100-300ug  
			Lasts 8-24 hours.

##Induction
* Performance of lumbar puncture is covered [here](/procedures/regional/lp.md).*

###Assessing Block
* By temperature  
As pain and temperature sensation are performed by the same pathway, assessing response to ice versus as central reference (e.g. forehead) can be used.
* By pain  
Assess response to pain (e.g. pinching with toothed forcepts) prior to commence operation
* By motor function  
Objective motor weakness indicates block level.


###Troubleshooting Block
* Block too low  
	* With a hyperbaric solution  
	Tilt the patient head down.
	* With a plan solution  
	Turn the patient supine and then prone again.
* Block too high



###Factors Affecting Block Spread
> With the exception of baricity and patient position, the influence of most of these factors is small and unpredictable

* Baricity  
Hyperbaric solutions behave more predictably due to the effect of gravity.
* Patient position  
Block height can be altered for up to 20 minutes post injection.
* Concentration and volume of LA
	* Volume determines extent of block
	* Dose (mg) determines block density  
	Therefore the same dose administered in a lower volume (i.e. higher concentration) causes a denser block.
* Level of injection  
Blocks achieve a denser block close to the level of injection.
* Speed of injection  
Slower injections produce more predictable spread.
* Intraabdominal pressure  
Affects epidural vein volume, which in turn affects CSF volume.

##Intraoperative
##Postoperative

##Complications
Can result either from:
* Dural puncture
	* Post Dural Puncture Headache
* Spinal anaesthesia
	* Bradycardia  
	Due to blockade of cardioaccelerator fibres.
		* If symptomatic, hypotensive, or excessively bradycardic  
		Consider atropine or glycopyrrolate.
	* Hypotension  
	Generally due to drop in SVR.
		* Vasopressors  
	* High/Total Spinal


###Total Spinal
* Spinal anaesthesia involving brain stem
* Difficult to predict  
May be difficult to induce even if intentional.
* Usually ~1:1000-1:5000  
Risk factors:
	* Total dose of local anaesthetic  
	Higher risk with inadvertent dural puncture.
	* Baricity  
	Hyperbaric solutions increase cephalad spread in head-down position.
	* Patient factors
		* Height
		* Anatomical  
		Separations within thecal sac.
		* Weight  
		Epidural venous congestion compresses intrathecal space.
	* CSE  
	Epidural injection may displace spinal solution cephalad.
* Features of spinal anaesthesia
	* **Rapid onset**  
	Usually (but not always) within 1-5 minutes.
	* High spinal symptoms
		* Bradycardia
		* Hypotension
		* Respiratory impairment
			* Difficulty once intercostals are paralysed  
			Note **whispering** and **inability to cough**.
			* Severe when phrenic nerve is paralyse  
		* Upper limb weakness
	* Cervical spine involvement


####Management of Total Spinal Anaesthesia
> This is an <span style="color:red">**anaesthetic crisis**</span>  
> Priority is to:
>* **Manage A-B-Cs**
>* **Deliver foetus** (if relevant)

#####<span style="color:red">Emergency Management</span>
Follows an ABC approach:
* A
	* Provide 100% oxygen
	* Assist ventilation if required
	* Intubate if apnoeic 
	Patient may still be aware and not-relaxed; perform a drug-assisted intubation.
* B
	* Support ventilation as above
* C
	* Volume  
	Fill dilated, compliant venous resevoir.
	* Vasopressors  
	* Inotropes  
	If bradycardia predominants. **50-100Âµg adrenaline** is a reasonable starting point.
* D
	* Post-intubation sedation  
	If required.
* Supportive therapy continues until total spinal has resolved  
May last 15 minutes to ~4 hours.


Foetal delivery:
* Foetal distress often present with maternal hypotension
* Delivery will improve maternal circulatory compromise
