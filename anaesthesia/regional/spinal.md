#Spinal Anaesthesia

Spinal anaesthesia is:
* Performed by injecting local anaesthetic into the CSF  
Typically below where the cord ends (L2).
	* Autonomic and pain fibres are blocked first  
	Vasodilation and hypotension correspond with block.
	* Motor fibres are blocked last  
	Motor fibres also recover first.
* Generally easy to perform  
* Useful for surgery below the umbilicus
* Cheap


##Indications
Relative:
* Patient factors
	* Difficult airway  
	Airway patency is maintained.
	* Respiratory disease  
	Less respiratory impairment than GA.
	* Frailty and systemic disease  
	Spinal anaesthesia tends to be less physiologically disruptive.
* Surgical factors
	* Sub-umbilical surgery
	* Muscle relaxation  
	Good operating conditions provided.
	* Reduced blood loss


##Contraindications
* Patient factors
	* AS  
	Afterload reduction results in decreased LV perfusion pressure.
	* Pulmonary hypertension  
	Afterload reduction results in decreased RV perfusion pressure.
	* Hypotension/hypovolaemia/shock states  
	Exacerbated by drop in SVR.
	* Anxiety/behavioural concern
	* Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia 
	Relative contraindication to LP.
	* Local infection  
	Contraindication to LP.
	* Sepsis
	* Hypersensitivity to LA
* Surgical factors
	* Operative duration  
	Surgery expected to last >2 hours will usualy require a different technique.



##Preoperative Assessment
Key factors:
* A
* B
* C
	* Volume and haemodynamic state
* D
	* Anxiety levels
* E
	* Back anatomy
	* Presence of local infection

##Preparation
* Alert the patient that spinal anaesthesia:
	* Removes pain but some sensation may remain  
	This will be weird or uncomfortable but shouldn't be painful
	* Causes motor weakness
* Standard ANZCA monitoring  
Regular (e.g. 1 minutely) BP after spinal injection.
* 18G or greater IVC
* Vasopressor available  
Consider infusion if it is necessary to defend SBP.
* LP equipment
* Local anaesthetic  
Classically bupivacaine is used:
	* Typically lasts **2-2.5 hours**
	* Can be either:
		* Hyperbaric/heavy bupivacaine  
		Mixed with 8% dextrose. Heavy bupivacaine:
			* Provides a denser block
			* Blocks more inferior nerve roots
			* Can be adjusted by adjusting the tilt of the table  
			For a block at L3/4:
				* Sitting patients will tend to achieve an upper block height on T7-T10  
				Allows a dense saddle block to be achieved.
				* Supine patients will tend to achieve an upper block of T4-T7
			* Dosing of heavy bupivacaine
				* Adults: 2-4ml (10-20mg)
				* <5kg: 0.4-0.5mg/kg
				* 5-15kg: 0.3-0.4mg/kg
				* 15-40: 0.25-0.3mg/kg
		* Plain bupivacaine  
		Mixed with saline online. Plain bupivacaine:
			* Tends to rise slightly
			* Cannot be adjusted
			* Dosing
				* Adults: 2-3.5ml 0.5% plain bupivacaine
		* Opioid  
		Opioid may be added to prolong the duration of analgesia and reduce the dose of LA required, at the risk of respiratory depression. Dosing:
			* Fentanyl 10-25ug  
			Lasts 1-4 hours.
			* Morphine 100-300ug  
			Lasts 8-24 hours.

##Induction
* Performance of lumbar puncture is covered [here](/procedures/regional/lp.md).*

###Assessing Block
* By temperature  
As pain and temperature sensation are performed by the same pathway, assessing response to ice versus as central reference (e.g. forehead) can be used.
* By pain  
Assess response to pain (e.g. pinching with toothed forcepts) prior to commence operation
* By motor function  
Objective motor weakness indicates block level.


###Troubleshooting Block
* Block too low  
	* With a hyperbaric solution  
	Tilt the patient head down.
	* With a plan solution  
	Turn the patient supine and then prone again.
* Block too high



###Factors Affecting Block Spread
> With the exception of baricity and patietn position, the influence of most of these factors is small and unpredictable

* Baricity  
Hyperbaric solutions behave more predictably due to the effect of gravity.
* Patient position  
Block height can be altered for up to 20 minutes post injection.
* Concentration and volume of LA
	* Volume determines extent of block
	* Dose (mg) determines block density  
	Therefore the same dose administered in a lower volume (i.e. higher concentration) causes a denser block.
* Level of injection  
Blocks achieve a denser block close to the level of injection.
* Speed of injection  
Slower injections produce more predictable spread.
* Intraabdominal pressure  
Affects epidural vein volume, which in turn affects CSF volume.

##Intraoperative
##Postoperative

##Complications
Can result either from:
* Dural puncture
	* Post Dural Puncture Headache
* Spinal anaesthesia
	* Bradycardia  
	Due to blockade of cardioaccelerator fibres.
		* If symptomatic, hypotensive, or excessively bradycardic  
		Consider atropine or glycopyrrolate.
	* Hypotension  
	Generally due to drop in SVR.
		* Vasopressors  
	* High/Total Spinal
