#Principles of Neuraxial Anaesthesia

*This section discusses factors common to spinal and epidural anaesthesia.*

##Indications
* Analgesia
* Anaesthesia

##Contraindications
Absolute contraindications:
* Patient refusal
* Anaphylaxis to local anaesthetics  
True allergy is rare.
* Anticoagulants  
Covered in detail in [principles of neuraxial anaesthesia](/anaesthesia/regional/principles/principles-neuraxial.md).
* Localised infection at insertion site
* Sepsis
    * Risk of infected blood/haematoma in the epidural or subarachnoid space
    * Exaggerated hypotension due to pre-existing vasodilation
    * Coagulopathy

Relative contraindications:
* Immunocompromise
* Coagulopathy
    * Epidural should be withheld in patients with pre-existing coagulopathy where intraoperative heparin administration is planned.
* Raised ICP
* Leukocytosis  
WCC > 20 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.
* CVS disease:
	* AS  
	Afterload reduction results in decreased LV perfusion pressure.
	* Pulmonary hypertension  
	Afterload reduction results in decreased RV perfusion pressure.
	* Hypotension/hypovolaemia/shock states  
	Exacerbated by drop in SVR.
* Anxiety/behavioural concern


##Anatomy
Lumbar:
* Generally between L2 and L5 interspaces
* Epidural space is an average of 5cm  (3-8 in 90%)

Thoracic:
* Avoid midline approach between T5 and T8

Cervical:
* Thin and soft ligamentum flavum leads to poor appreciation of LoR
* Space is ~ 1.5-2mm deep at C7, increases to 3-4mm with neck flexion


###Coagulopathy{#coag}
In general:
* Coagulation studies be performed prior to insertion if there is any concern  
Any abnormality of coagulation is always a *relative* contraindication.
* Risk of haematoma exists on a continuum - a platelet count of 79 is not substantially more risky than a platelet count of 81.
* Risk varies depending on technique  
Paravertebral is less risky than a spinal, which is less risky than a single-shot epidural, which is less risky than an epidural catheter.
* Absolute thresholds will vary depending on the centre; one particular set of numbers is:
    * Normal APTT
    * INR < 1.5
    * Platelets > 80 x 10<sup>12</sup>/L  
    Above 100 is idea, < 70 can be considered an absolute contraindication.
* Strong history of bleeding  
Even in presence of normal coagulation studies.

###Anticoagulants

|Drug|Time between last dose and epidural insertion/adjustment/removal|Time before next dose|
|--|--|--|
|**Heparin** <br>5,000 Units S/C|8 hours.|8 hours.|
|**Heparin** Infusion|6 hours since cessation, and a normal APTT.|Restart 8 hours after infusion, or 24 hours if bloody tap.|
|**Heparin** IV intraoperative|Removal > 4 hours after last dose.|1 hour between placement and first dose.
|**Enoxaparin** (prophylactic)|12 hours, 24 hours post-operative.|2 hours|
|**Enoxaparin** (therapeutic)|24 hours.|2 hours|
|**Warfarin**|INR < 1.5 prior to insertion. Warfarin cannot be used with an epidural in situ - use UFH.|INR < 1.5 prior to removal.|
|**Aspirin**|2-3 days prior to cervical/thoracic epidural placement.|-|
|**NSAIDs**|-|-|
|**Clopidogrel**|7 days for insertion, can consider 5 days if high cardiac risk.|12-24 hours following catheter removal (24 hours if loading dose to be given).|
|**Ticagrelor**|5 days|6 hours following catheter removal|
|**Prasugrel**|7-10 days|6 hours following catheter removal|
|**Rivaroxaban**|At least 2 days.|6 hours.
|**GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors**|At least 2 days. Seek expert advice.|Seek expert advice.
|**Dabigatran**|48 hours||
|**Thrombin inhibitors** including bivalirudin, lepirudin|Avoid. Seek expert advice.|Seek expert advice.
|**Thrombolytics**|10 days.|Measure fibrinogen level prior to removal. Seek expert advice.|
|**Herbal** including garglic, gingseng, and gingo bilboa|-|-|
