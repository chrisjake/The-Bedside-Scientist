#Peribulbar Block

The peribulbar block:
* Involves injection of LA into the **extraconal space** around the eyeball
	* A larger volume is used to facilitate intraconal spread of LA
* Preferrable to retrobulbar block as it has a lower rate of complications



##Indications
Anaesthesia and akinesia of the globe for:
* Cataract extraction
* Trabeculectomy
* Vitrectomy
* Strabismus repair


##Contraindications
Should be avoided when:
* Axial length is **>26mm**  
Increased risk of globe perforation.
* Severe coagulopathy
* Perforated globe
* Infected eye
* Inability to lie flat

##Anatomy
The orbit:
* Takes a truncated pyramid shape
* Contains mostly fat
* Holds the globe in the anterior part  
The equator of the globe lies at the lateral border.

The globe is:
* Spherical
* Encased in **Tenon's capsule** over the scleral portion  
Elastic white connective tissue layer that surrounds the globe. It lies deep to the conjunctiva, which it merges with ~1mm from the limbus.
* Has six muscular attachments:
	* The four rectus muscles form the retrobulbar cone  
	Contact the walls of the orbit.
		* The intraconal space lies within these muscular attachments  
		Intraconal injection of local anaesthetic produces anaesthesia and akinesia of the globe and extraocular muscles.
		* The extraconal space is a potential space lying between these muscles and the orbital wall


##Equipment
* Gauze
* Antiseptic  
Typically 50% saline with 50% aqueous betadine
* Topical local anaesthetic drops
* Mix LA solution  
Many different options exist.
	* Lignocaine/ropivacaine
		* Take two ampoules of 10mls of 0.75% ropivacaine, 10% lignocaine, and 150 units of hyaluronidase
		* Add the hyalase to one ampoule of 0.75% ropivacaine, producing ~15U/ml of hyalase in ~0.75% ropivacaine
		* Into a 10ml syringe, draw up 7ml of 0.75% ropivacaine, 2ml of 10% lignocaine, and 1ml of the ropivacaine/hyalase mixture  
		This will give a total volume of 10mls of ~0.6% ropivacaine, 2% lignocaine, and 15U/ml hyaluronidase.
	* Ropivacaine alone  
	0.75-1% ropivacaine with 75-150 U/ml hyaluronidase.
* A needle  
Typically 23-27G.
* A syringe  
Typically 10ml.
* Minimum volume extension  
Removes weight of syringe from needle improving manual dexterity.


##Technique
*Assumes monitoring, IV access, time-out, topical local anaesthetic drops, and sedation have been performed, as discussed [here](/anaesthesia/opthal/opthal-la.md#id).*

* Apply antiseptic  
Ensure there is some antiseptic under the lower lid and in the conjunctival sac.
* Ask the patient to look directly ahead
* Perform block:
	* Palpate **medial two-thirds** and **lateral one-third** of the inferior rim of the orbit
	* Using a 23-27G needle, advance **directly backwards**  
	Parallel to orbital floor.
	**Limit insertion depth to 25mm**.
		* If contacting bone, redirect slightly superiorly
		* If the globe rotates, this suggests scleral contact
	* Aspirate, then inject 4-10ml of LA
		* Cease injection if the globe becomes tense
* Use digital pressure or a Honan balloon to compress the globe, reducing LA volume and therefore IOP
* Assess for block efficacy
* If required, a **top-up block** can be performed with a **different technique**:
	* Place the needle at the medial canthus
	* Aim towards the medial wall of the orbit
	* Inject 3-4ml LA


##Complications{#comp}
Minor complications:
* Chemosis  
Subconjunctival swelling. Transient.
* Venous haemorrhage  
Cosmetic but rarely significant.
* Arterial haemorrhage  
May be dramatic, leading to rise in IOP. Usually requires postponing OT, but may require canthotomy.


Major complications:
* Globe perforation  
Due to direct trauma.
	* Increased risk with myopia, repeated injections
	* Presents with ocular pain, intraocular haemorrhage, restlessness  
	May not be immmediately obvious.
* Retrobulbar haemorrhage  
Due to direct trauma.
	* Presents with brusing, propotosis, and pain  
	Inadequate retinal artery flow may require a lateral canthotomy to relieve IOP and prevent loss of vision.
	* May be subtle, occasionally presents as rapid orbital swelling and proptosis. 
* Optic nerve damage  
Due to direct injury or vascular occlusion.
	* Presents with visual loss
* Intraarterial injection  
Flow down the ICA may result in the dose of LA being delivered directly to midbrain structures.
	* May present with seizure or CVS toxicity
* Brainstem anaesthesia  
Due to needle passing through the nerve sheath, resulting in subarachnoid deposition of LA.
	* May present with a broad array of symptoms, including respiratory or CVS arrest, agitation, ptosis, dysphagia, confusion
* Oculocardic reflex  
Due to raised intraocular pressure.
	* Presents with bradycardia, which may be profound.
