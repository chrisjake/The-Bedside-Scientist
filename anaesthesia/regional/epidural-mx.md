#Epidural Troubleshooting
*This covers common and serious problems with both labour and post-operative epidurals.*

Include:
* Inadequate analgesia
    * Patchy block
    * Asymmetric block
    * Diminished block
* Inadequate perineal analgesia


###Inadequate Analgesia
Can be defined as:
* Pain > 5
* Inability to cough or move effectively

May be associated with:
* Patchy block
* Asymmetric block
* Diminishing analgesia


Management process:
* Assess vitals
* Exclude surgical cause of pain
* Check pump on and working correctly
* Check catheter is connected
* Check catheter location  
Catheter may migrate out of the epidural space.
    * Check anticoagulation status prior to manipulation
* Check BP  
Hypotension and uncorrected hypovolaemia are relative contraindications to epidural bolus.
* Assess block
    * Patchy
    * Asymmetric
    * Dimishing analgesia


####Patchy Block
* Immediately patchy blocks may be misplaced; **consider replacing**  
e.g. subdural, paravertebral, threaded over nerve root.
* Bolus with a moderately concentrated solution  
e.g. 0.125-0.25% bupivacaine.

####Asymmetric/Unilateral Block
Generally indicates catheter is too far within the space:
* Withdraw catheter by 1cm and bolus  
Place in lateral position (un-blocked side down) to improve onset of block
* Catheter can be pulled back up to 3cm within the space


####Diminishing Analgesia
A rescue bolus of LA can be delivered to re-establish a failing epidural.
* Ensure adequate monitoring
* Ensure working IV access
* Ensure vasopressor is readily available
* Give a rescue bolus  
The end point is either analgesia or side effects.
    * Appropriate agents include:
        * 0.25% bupivacaine  
        6-10ml is appropriate for most adult patients, though more will sometimes be required.
        * Ropivacaine 0.35%
        * Ropivacaine 0.2%
    * If analgesia is achieved:
        * Increase rate by one-third
        * Change solution
    * If no block to ice is present:
        * Consider alternate methods of analgesia



###Inadequate Perineal Analgesia
Perineal analgesia is important at time of delivery. Block can be augmented with:
* LA bolus  
    * 6-8ml of 0.125% bupivacaine
    * 3-4ml of 0.25% bupivacaine
* Fentanyl  
50-100Î¼g augments analgesia without providing motor block.
* Position in semi-Fowler's  
Enhances perineal analgesia from epidural.


**Dosing** for **forceps delivery** or **episiotomy**:
* Requires dense blockade with concentrated LA
* Consider:
    * 1-2% lignocaine
    * 0.25-0.5% bupivacaine


##Neurological Injury
Can be divided into:
* Anaesthesia/epidural related
* Obstetric/surgery related

###Anaesthesia Related
Anaethetic-related neurology includes:
* Prolonged neural blockade
    * May last 10-48 hours  
    * Ultimately resolves
* Bladder dysfunction  
Associated with:
    * Urinary retention due to epidural anaesthesia  
    Can be avoided with IDC.
* Direct trauma/neuritis
    * May occur from intraneural injection of LA
    * Leads to paraesthesia/sensory/motor loss in a specific dermatomal distribution.
* **Epidural haematoma**
    * Rare  
    Increased risk with coagulopathy.
* **Epidural abscess/meningitis**  
Key features:
    * Severe back pain
    * Local tenderness
    * Fever
    * Leukocytosis
* Adhesive arachnoiditis
* Anterior spinal artery syndrome


###Obstetric/Surgery Related
Obstetric neurology:
* Occurs in 1:2400-6500
* Associated with:
    * Prolonged labour
    * Forceps delivery
* Typically causes neurology in a **peripheral nerve distribution**
