#Axillary Plexus Block

##Indications
* Anaesthesia and analgesia for:
	* Distal upper arm
	* Forearm A-V fistula.
	* Wrist and Hand  
	e.g. carpal ORIF, carpectomy, metacarpal ORIF, proximal phalanx ORIF, fasciectomy, dupuytren's contracture.
* Sympathicolysis
* Pain syndromes

##Contraindications
##Anatomy
##Equipment
* 50-100mm 21G needle
* Local anaesthetic  
20-30ml of:
	* 1.5-2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline
	* 0.75-1% ropivacaine  
	0.2-0.375% ropivacaine appropriate for postoperative analgesia only, or if early neurological assessment required.
	* 1% lignocaine with 0.5% ropivacaine
* High or intermediate frequency linear transducer


##Technique
* Position
	* Supine
	* Head turned to contralateral side
	* Position ipsilateral arm above head  
	i.e. Externally rotated with 90Â° of abduction and elbow flexion.

###Ultrasound Guided Approaches
* Place US probe
	* Perpendicular to skin
	* In short axis along the line of pectoralis major
* Identify axillary artery  
Nerves are located *mostly* around the artery:
	* Median is superoanteriorly
	* Ulnar inferoposteriorly
	* Radial posteriorly
	* Musculocutaneous is located either:
		* Commonly in a facial plane between biceps brachii and coracobrachialis
		* Within coracobrachialis
* Trace nerves to elbow and return
* Place 5ml of LA around each nerve  
Target deeper nerves first.
