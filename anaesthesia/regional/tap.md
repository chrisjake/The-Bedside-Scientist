#Transversus Abdominis Plane Block

The TAP block is a regional technique to provide analgesia to the anterior abdominal wall, between the mid-clavicular lines. There are three approaches:
* Posterior approach  
Performed laterally above the iliac crest, and provides analgesia below the umbilicus
* Subcostal approach  
Performed under the costal margin, lateral to the rectus, and provides periumbilical analgesia
* Oblique subcostal approach  
Multiple injections along the oblique subcostal line, pr

##Indications
* Abdominal surgery where epidural would be excessive or contraindicated

##Anatomy
* The TAP lies between the rectus abdominus and transversus abdominus muscles in the anterolateral abdominal wall
	* The internal and external oblique muscles separate rectus and transversus abdominus more laterally
	* Transversus abdominus may not be present superiorly  
	If a block is performed here, then LA should be injected superior to the posterior rectus sheath.
* The TAP contains the thoracolumber nerves (T6-L1) which innervate the abdominal wall
* Thoracolumber nerves consist of intercostal, subcostal, iliohypogastric, and ilioinguinal nerves
* All travel beneath the rectus and run for a variable distance through the TAP before penetrating the rectus sheath  
This may occur quite laterally, so **medial blocks may miss the nerve** as it travels through the TAP.

##Equipment
* Ultrasound machine, gel, probe cover  
High or low frequency probe acceptable.
* Needle and catheter kit  
e.g. 18G Touhy.
* Local anaesthetic  
Typically 3mg/kg ropivacine (up to 200mg) diluted with N/S to 40ml (20ml each side)
* Sterile equipment


##Technique
* Prepare equipment
* Identify the rectus abdominus and transversus abdominus muscle at the costal margin

* Scan inferiorly to identify the TAP at the level of the surgical incision
* Place the needle medial to the probe (close to midline), and travel inferolaterally towards the iliac crest into the TAP

* Hydrodisect the TAP with 1-2ml of LA solution to confirm correct placement
* Wound catheters may also be placed  
	* Use epidural or nerve block catheters
	* Catheters may be left up to **5 days**
	* Catheters may be managed as:
		* Regular boluses (e.g. 20ml of LA solution) Q6H
		* Continuous infusion (e.g. 5ml/hr ropivacaine 0.2%)
