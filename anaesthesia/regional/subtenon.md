#Sub-Tenon's Block

A sub-Tenon's (episcleral) block:
* Involves injecting LA between the sclera and Tenon's capsule  
Causes spread of LA around the globe with a small volume of injection.

##Indications
Anaesthesia and akinesia of the globe, in a patient with:
* Increased axial length
* Presence of anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents

##Contraindications
Surgical factors:
* Trabeculectomy  
May reduce operative success.
* Previous sub-Tenon block in the same quadrant  
Adhesions may reduce efficacy of hydrodissection.
* Complete akinesia required
* Where chemosis or haemorrhage may reduce outcome  
Glaucoma filtration surgery.


Relative contraindications:
* Eye trauma
* Orbital infection
* Ocular pemphigoid


##Anatomy
The orbit:
* Takes a truncated pyramid shape
* Contains mostly fat
* Holds the globe in the anterior part  
The equator of the globe lies at the lateral border.


The globe is:
* Spherical
* Encased in **Tenon's capsule** over the scleral portion  
Elastic white connective tissue layer that surrounds the globe. It lies deep to the conjunctiva, which it merges with ~1mm from the limbus.
* Has six muscular attachments:
	* The four rectus muscles form the retrobulbar cone  
	Contact the walls of the orbit.
		* The intraconal space lies within these muscular attachments  
		Intraconal injection of local anaesthetic produces anaesthesia and akinesia of the globe and extraocular muscles.
		* The extraconal space is a potential space lying between these muscles and the orbital wall


##Equipment 
* Gauze
* Antiseptic  
Typically 50% saline with 50% aqueous betadine
* Topical local anaesthetic drops
* Mix LA solution  
Many different options exist. One approach:
	* Take two ampoules of 10mls of 0.75% ropivacaine, 10% lignocaine, and 150 units of hyaluronidase
	* Add the hyalase to one ampoule of 0.75% ropivacaine, producing ~15U/ml of hyalase in ~0.75% ropivacaine
	* Into a 10ml syringe, draw up 7ml of 0.75% ropivacaine, 2ml of 10% lignocaine, and 1ml of the ropivacaine/hyalase mixture  
	This will give a total volume of 10mls of ~0.6% ropivacaine, 2% lignocaine, and 15U/ml hyaluronidase.


* Eye speculum
* Fine non-toothed forceps
* Scissors  
Preferably spring scissors.
* Sub-Tenon cannula


##Technique
*Assumes monitoring, IV access, time-out, topical local anaesthetic drops, and sedation have been performed, as discussed [here](/anaesthesia/opthal/opthal-la.md#id).*

The surgical approach involves:
* Topical LA drops  
Onto intranasal quadrant as this is more comfortable.
* Apply antiseptic  
Ensure there is some antiseptic under the lower lid and in the conjunctival sac.
* Ask the patient to look directly up and out
* Perform block:
	* With small forceps, push in and then grab the inferonasal quadrant of the globe 5-10mm from the limbus  
	The infranasal quadrant is preferred as there are no muscle insertions and it is not used for a surgical approach.
	* Keep pressure on the globe with the forceps throughout the procedure
	* Use the scissors to create a **linear** incision in the Tenon's capsule  
	Bring the scissors in vertically to create a straight incision. A curved incision creates a conjunctival flap, and may cause a cyst.
	* Perform blunt dissection with the scissors past the equator of the globe
	* Insert a blunt cannula into the episcleral space, tangential to the globe
	* Inject LA
		* 3-5ml typically produces good analgesia but only partial akinesia
		* 8-11ml produces akinesia via spread of LA to extraocular muscle sheaths
* Remove speculum

##Complications
*Mechanism of copmplications are similar to [peribulbar blocks](/procedures/regional/peribulbar.md#comp), but are typically much less common.*


Minor complications:
* Chemosis  
Almost universal.
* Pain on injection
* Subconjunctival haemorrhage

Major complications:
* Brainstem anaesthesia
* Globe perforation
* Retrobulbar haemorrhage
* Retinal ischaemia  
May occur in absence of retrobulbar haemorrhage, and result in permanent visual loss.
* Optic nerve damage
* Rectus muscle dysfunctikon  
May be due to direct trauma and haemoatoma formation, leading to muscular contracture.
