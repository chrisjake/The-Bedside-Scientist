#Penetrating Eye Injuries

>Airway: ETT usual given emergent surgery and remote airway. <br>
>Access: 20G IV<br>
>Pain: Substantial intraoperative stimulation, requiring deep analgesia or anaesthesia. <br>
>Position: Aim head elevated to reduce IOP <br>
>Time: Variable <br>
>Blood loss: Negligible <br>
>Special: IOP control critical <br>

Major issues with anaesthetic management include:
* Avoidance of increased IOP  
Risks evacuation of ocular contents.
* Emergency surgery


##Surgical Stages
##Preoperative
Assessment:
* Size of defect  
Affects risk of evacuation of ocular contents.
* Mechanism  
Associated injuries.

Premedication:
* Consider anxiolytic

##Intraoperative
> * Goal is to avoid increase in IOP  
> Most anaesthetic agents lower IOP, including:
> 	* Opioids
> 	* Volatiles
>	* IV hypnotics

Induction:
* RSI
* Suxamethonium can be used, noting that it is associated with a (mild) rise in IOP
* Rocuronium/sugammadex is also an appropriate combination
* Lignocaine 1-1.5mg/kg prior to induction to minimise IOP increases with laryngoscopy


Maintenance:
* Deep anaesthesia required to avoid coughing
* Nitrous oxide is acceptable provided there is no air in the eye

Emergence:
* Cough-free extubation is critical to avoid associated rise in IOP

##Postoperative
Control of PONV to avoid vomiting and rise in IOP:
* Two antiemetics prior to emergence
