Local anaesthetic with or without sedation is a common technique for many ocular surgeries including:
* Trabeculectomy  
50-80 minutes.
* Intraocular Lens Insertion


##Techniques
Different methods for LA include:
* Topical  
Provides corneal anaesthesia.
	* Adequate for cataract surgery by phacoemulsification  
	Does not provide akinesia.
* [Peribulbar Block](/procedures/regional/peribulbar.md#id)  
The most commonly used injection technique.
* [Sub-Tenon's Block](/procedures/regional/subtenon.md)  
A useful alternative when a peri-bulbar block is contraindicated.
* Retrobulbar block  
Produces better akinesis and lower IOP than a peribulbar block, but has greater associated risks and is essentially superseded by a peribulbar block.


##Considerations
##Preoperative
Assessment should consider:
* **Axial length**  
Determines which technique would be more appropriate.
* Coagulation profile
* BSL
* Ability to lie flat
* Hearing
* Anxiety levels  
Determine whether sedation will be required.

##Perioperative
Eye surgery under LA:
* Carries very little risk  
Predominant morbidity related to oversedation.
* Should have basic monitoring
* Should have IV access


##Postoperative
