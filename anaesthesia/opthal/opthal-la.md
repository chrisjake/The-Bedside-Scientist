Local anaesthetic with or without sedation is a common technique for many ocular surgeries including:
* Trabeculectomy  
50-80 minutes.
* Intraocular Lens Insertion


##Techniques
Different methods for injecting LA include:
* Peribulbar Block  
Preferable to retrobulbar block as it has a lower rate of complications. **Contraindicated when**:
	* Axial length is >25mm  
	Increased risk of globe perforation.
	* Anticoagulation
	* Perforated globe
	* Infected eye
	* Inability to lie flat
* Sub-tenon's Block  
Preferred in anticoagulated patients and those with longer axial lengths.

###Peribulbar (Extraconal) Block
Technique:
* Gain IV access
* Attach monitoring
* Time out
* Give sedation  
Many appropriate techniques:
	* Midazolam 0.5-2mg
	* Propofol 10-30mg with alfentanil 250ug
	* Propofol 10-20 mg with ketamine 10mg and alfentanil 100-250ug
* Topical LA
* Ask the patient to look directly ahead
* Perform block:
	* Palpate **medial two-thirds** and **lateral one-third** of the inferior rim of the orbit
	* Using a 23G needle, advance **directly backwards**  
		* If contacting bone, redirect slightly superiorly
		* If the globe rotates, this suggests scleral contact
	* Aspirate, then inject 4-10ml of LA
		* Cease injection if the globe becomes tense
* Use digital pressure or a Honan balloon to compress the globe, reducing LA volume and therefore IOP
* Assess for block efficacy
* If required, a **top-up block** can be performed with a **different technique**:
	* Plce the needle at the medial canthus
	* Aim towards the medial wall of the orbit
	* Inject 3-4ml LA

Complications:
* Globe perforation  
Rate, but mayh not be obvious.
* Retrobulbar haemorrhage  
May be subtle, occasionally presents as rapid orbital swelling and proptosis. Inadequate retinal artery flow may require a lateral canthotomy.


###Sub-Tenon's Block
Technique:
* Gain IV access
* Attach monitoring
* Time out
* Give sedation
* Topical LA
* Perform block:
	* Blunt incision in conjunctiva, followed by dissection in plane between the sclera and Tenon's capsule
	* Blunt cannula placed beneath Tenon's capsulre
	* Inject 3-8ml LA

##Considerations
##Preoperative
Assessment should consider:
* **Axial length**  
Determines which technique would be more appropriate.
* Coagulation profile
* BSL
* Ability to lie flat
* Hearing
* Anxiety levels  
Determine whether sedation will be required.

##Perioperative
##Postoperative
