>Airway: Nil <br>
>Access: 22G or 20G IVC <br>
>Pain: May result in post-ictal headache <br>
>Position: Supine or sitting <br>
>Time: Minutes <br>
>Blood loss: Nil <br>
>Special: Typically remote setting with paucity of resuscitation staff available <br>

ECT involves transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the brain to produce generalised seizures in order to treat certain psychiatric disorders.

##Considerations
* C
	* Arrythmias and MI are the primary cause of ECT-related mortality
* D
	* Underlying psychiatric illness
	* Altered mental status  
	Patients may wake up confused or floridly delirous.
	* Amnesia  
	Period of anterograde and retrograde amnesia around ECT.
		* Rarely may become prolonged with  long durations of ECT treatment
* E
	* Adequate muscle relaxation is essential to prevent
		* Teeth damage from masseter spasm  
		Most common injury.
		* Postictal headache  
		Due to dilation of meningeal vessels.
		* Haemodynamic upset  
		May last minutes to over an hour post-procedure:
			* Bradyarrythmias in 30% due to vagal activation
			* Followed by increased sympathetic tone with elevated HR and BP

##Preoperative Assessment
Evaluation should consider:
* CVS  
ECT is **contraindicated**:
	* <3 months post MI (absolute)
	* Aortic aneurysm, angina, CHF, thrombophlebitis (relative)
* Presence of PPM  
Magnet should be available.


##Preparation
* Standard ANZCA monitoring
* IV access

##Induction
Usually can be performed with brief sedation and sub-intubating dose muscle relaxation without a secured airway, e.g.:
* Preoxygenation
* Induction with propofol (1-2mg/kg)
* Partial relaxation with suxamethonium (e.g. 0.6-1mg/kg)
* Assisted mask ventilation may be required until spontaneous ventilation resumes

##Intraoperative
* Labetalol or esmolol may be required for treatment of hypertension
* Atropine may be required for treatment of bradycardia

###Surgical Stages

##Postoperative
