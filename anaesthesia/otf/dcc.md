#Direct Current Cardioversion

>Airway: Own, consider RSI if requires airway protection <br>
>Access: Small IV <br>
>Pain: Requires sedation. Myalgias may be present post-operatively. <br>
>Position: Semi-erect <br>
>Time: Minutes <br>
>Blood loss: Nil <br>
>Special: Requirement for anticoagulation; risk of burns

Restoring sinus rhythm through use of a brief electrical discharge across the heart.

##Considerations
* A
	* Airway protection  
	May be required if emergent/unfasted.
* C
	* Optimised for successful cardioversion
		* Nil digoxin toxicity
		* Normal electrolytes
	* Underlying CVS disease  
	May pre-dispose to CVS dysfunction with anaesthesia.
* E
	* Fire risk
		* Remove facemask oxygen
		* Remove GTN patches

##Preparation
* Standard ANZCA monitoring
* Preoxygenation

##Induction
* Gentle IV induction  
Consider:
	* 1-1.5mg/kg propofol given slowly
	* Alfentanil
	* Remifentanil

##Intraoperative
Intraoperative complications include:
* VF
* Catecholamine surge  
May precipitate MI.
* Asystole

##Postoperative
* ECG to verify NSR
