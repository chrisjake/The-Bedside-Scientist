#Patient Transport

Transport may involve
* Primary retrieval  
Retrieval from scene of injury to a hospital.
* Secondary retrieval  
Interhospital transport.
* Intra-hospital transport  
Transport of a critically ill patient within the hospital.

##Modes of Transport
Choice of transportation vehicle will depend on:
* Clinical requirements
	* Nature of illness
	* Effect of transport method on the illness
	* Urgency
* Vehicle availability and suitability
	* Safety
	* Power and gas supply
	* Lighting and climate control
	* Restraints for stretcher
	* Communication systems
	* Suction
	* Number of retrieval personnel
	* Amount of equipment
	* Time taken to transport
	* Range and speed of vehicle
	* Weather and road conditions
	* Staffing traning on transport platform
* Conditions at the referring and receiving centre
	* Location
	* Distance

###Risks of Air Transport
Pressure effects:
* Reduced PO<sub>2</sub>
* Requirement for pressurisation
* Risk of rapid depressurisation
* Expansion of gases
	* Air emboli
	* ETT cuff
	* Middle-ear
	* Airfilled spaces
		* Under dressing
	* DCI risk

Other effects:
* Limb swelling
* Temperature changes
* Humidity changes
* Acceleration, deceleration, turbulence
* Electromagmetic interference
* Motion sickness

##Prerequesites
* Secure airway
* IV access
* Secure catheters
* Appropriate monitoring
* Adequate infusion and fluid volume


##Equipment
Needs depend on requirements:
* Transport duration  
Oxygen and drug supplies should exceed estimated maximum transport time.
* Severity of illness
