#Environmental Sustainability

Climate change has:
* A significant impact on health outcomes
* Partially resulted from healthcare  
	* 7% of Australian CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are from healthcare
	* 5% of hospital CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are from anaesthesia

##Anaesthetic Impacts
Inhalational anaesthetic agents:
* Have significant and sustained environmental impact
* Methods to reduce
	* Avoid use of desflurane and nitrous oxide
	* Use low-flows
	* Minimise use of inhalational agents
		* TIVA
		* Regional

Other:
* Ensure appropriate use of sharps and biohazard bins

##Operating Theatre Impacts
Generate 20-25% of hospital waste.
* 60% of OT waste is recyclable

Reusable equipment:
* Surgical gowns
* Surgical hats
* Anaesthesia equipment
	* Laryngoscopes
	* LMAs
	* Masks
	* Circuits
	* Avoid unnecessary use of drugs

##Hospital Impacts
Infrastructure:
* Heating and cooling considerations
	* Occupancy-sensing
* Water use
	* Auto-off taps	
* Power generation


Diagnostic Tests:
* Sensible test ordering
