#Consent

Every individual has a right to:
* Determine what is done to their body
* Know the implications of any medical treatment provided
* Seek clarification of any issues of concern

##Elements of Consent
Consent requires:
* **Voluntarily and without coercion**  
Refusal and withdrawal must be a realistic option.
* **Capacity**  
Everyone is assumed to be competent unless there are reasonable grounds for believing otherwise.
	* In absence of capacity, another person can give consent on behalf of the patient in certain legally-defined circumstances  
	They are legally obligated to act in the best interests of the person for whom consent is being given.
	* Age  
	One must be old enough to understand the nature, purpose, and consequences of the treatment; as well as the consequences of non-treatment.
		* Treatment can proceed without
	* A legal guardian may need to be appointed, or a statutory body (e.g. Guardianship board) may beed to give consent if the individual does not have capacity and there is no currently existing legal guardian available
* **Informed**
	* Information that a reasonable patient in their position *might* wish to know and attach significance  
	Includes information about risk that would be significant to:
		* A reasonable individual in this position
		* **This particular patient**  
		This is the concept of **material risk**.
	* Basic information must be provided, even if the patient requests no information  
	If staunch refusal exists, then this should be documented.


###Risk
Discussion of risk should:
* Be based upon:
	* Seriousness and nature of the condition
	* Complexity of the surgery
	* Questions asked by the patient
	* Patients attitude and level of understanding
* Include:
	* Rare but severe harms
	* Common but minor harms
	* Uncertainty relating to outcomes
	* The **risk of doing nothing**
	* Financial implications  
	If relevant.
* Be performed by:
	* A person able to understand and discuss the risks and benefits of the treatment
	* A qualified interpreter if necessary  
	Not a family member.
	* The anaesthetist providing the anaesthetic
		* A separate anaesthetist may interview and discuss risk with the patient, but the treating anaesthetist is liable if inadequate consent is obtained by another on their behalf

###Exceptions
Treatment can proceed without consent if:
* The situation is so urgent that immediate intervention is necessary to preserve life or prevent serious harm  
Provision of information and discussion of treatment undertaken must be done as soon as possible.
* Treatment is:  
(Seek legal advice before proceeding with this justification).
	* In the patients best interests
	* Reasonable stepts have been taken to determine the patients views
	* Believed by the doctor to have been chosen by the patient if they were competent to do so  
	* Required immediately to prevent further injury to the patient
