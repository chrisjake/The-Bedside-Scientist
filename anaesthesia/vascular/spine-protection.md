#Spinal Cord Protection

Paraplegia following descending aortic surgery:
* Occurs in 2-6% of patients
Due to a combination of factors:
	* Aortic occlusion with cross-clamp
	* Destruction of intercostal arteries
	* Embolisation
		* Air
		* Plaque
* Continues despite major improvements in surgical technique
* May occur:
	* Immediately  
	Generally poor prognosis.
	* Delayed  
	Better prognosis. Manged with:
		* CSF pressure drained to 10mmHg
		* MAP increased to 100mmHg


##Mechanisms for Spinal Cord Protection
Consider:
* **Partial CPB**
	* Bypass of left heart
	* Access cannula placed into the left atrium, with a return cannula into the femoral artery  
	Oxygenator can be used, but is not required.
	* Anterograde flow is provided to vessels distal to cross clamp
* **Nerve monitoring**  
	* Include:
		* SSEPs  
		Indicate dorsal column function by stimulating the posterior tibial nerve and recording cortical response.
		* MEPs  
		Indicate spinothalamic tract function by stimulating motor cortex and recording anterior tibial muscle response.
	* Indicator of ischaemia
	* Allows surgical technique to be adapted
	* Significant false positives
* **Lumbar drain**
	* Optimise spinal perfusion pressure by draining CSF
	* Recommended in patients with high risk of ischaemia
	* Place a lumbar drain with a
	* Also facilitates regional hypothermia of cord  
	Aim to cool at the watershed area of T8-L1.
* **Hypothermia**
	* 
	* May be:
		* Active  
		With CPB circuit.
		* Passive  
		Hypothermia of anaesthesia.
