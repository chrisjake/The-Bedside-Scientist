#Aortic Cross-Clamp

Dramatic physiological changes occur following clamping of the descending aorta:
* Exact haemodynamic responses vary depending on the level
	* Supra-coeliac clamping consistently redirects blood flow and has predictable responses
	* Infra-coeliac clamping is inconsistent, but less dramatic

##Physiology of Clamping
Immediate effects:
* ↑ Afterload
	* ↑ Systemic BP
	* May precipitate LV failure
	* Have a profound afterload-reducing agent available 
	**GTN**, **SNP**, **nicardipine**.
* ↑ Preload  
Due to redistribution in blood volume:
	* ↓ Venous capacitance distal to clamp  
	Ejection of blood from splanchnic beds.
	* ↑ Venous capacitance proximal to clamp
		* ↑ CVP
		* ↑ PCWP
		* ↑ LVEDP
* Contractility  
Effect varies depending on **capacity to ↑ coronary flow** in the setting of ↑ O<sub>2</sub> demand:
	* Adequate coronary supply  
	↑ Contractility as a response to ↑ in preload and afterload.
	* Inadequate coronary supply  
	Diastolic dysfunction, ↑↑ LVEDP, ↓ CO.
* ↑ Myocardial oxygen consumption

Short-term effects:
* ↓ Global oxygen consumption  
Both distal and proximal to clamp.
	* ↑ MV PO<sub>2</sub>
* ↓ Spinal perfusion pressure  
Due to combination of:
	* ↓ Spinal blood flow
	* ↑ CSF pressure
* ↑ Catecholamines
* ↑ Renin and angiotensin
* ↓↓ Renal blood flow
	* ↓ GFR
	* ↓ UO
	* Ischaemia-reperfusion injury  
	Subsequent AKI.
	* **0.25mg/kg of mannitol** is often given to maintain urine output, without much evidence


Long term effects:
* ↑ SVR  
Continues to ↑ with ↑ duration of cross-clamping.


##Aortic Unclamping
Immediate effects:
* ↑ ETCO<sub>2</sub>  
Due to ischaemic washout.
	* **Minimise washout** by **unclamping each lower limb separately**
* ↓ SVR  
Distal circulation is profoundly vasodilated due to ischaemia; release of clamp makes this dilated and relatively volume deplete circulation available.
	* ↓ BP  
	May be profound. Give **volume** targeting **slightly elevated filling pressures** prior to release.
		* **Vasodilators** given **prior to release** allow **extra volume without increasing filling pressures**
		* If **BP remains low**, then have the surgeon **reapply the clamp**; and give more volume.
* ↓ Preload  
Due to:
	* Central hypovolaemia  
	Blood pooling into re-perfused tissues.
	* Venodilation  
	Secondary to hypoxia.
* CO  
May ↓, ↑, or remain unchanged depending on relative effect of:
	* ↓ SVR
	* ↓ Preload
	* Ischaemic washout  
	Generally ↓ inotropy.
* Acidosis  
Lactic acidosis due to re-perfusion of ischaemic tissues.


Short-term effects:
* ↑ Renin and angiotensin release


Long-term effects:
* Persistent ↓ GFR and RBF  
May remain ↓ for up to 6 months post-operatively.
