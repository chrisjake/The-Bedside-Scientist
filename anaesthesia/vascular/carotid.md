#Carotid Endarterectomy
>Airway: ETT or spontaneous ventilation. <br>
>Access: Large IVC, arterial line. <br>
>Pain: Minimal <br>
>Position: Supine, neck extended and rotated <br>
>Time: ~90 minutes total <br>
>Blood loss: 100-300ml <br>
>Special: Additional monitoring may include stump pressure monitor, cerebral perfusion monitor, or patient interaction with regional techniques <br>



Resection of ICA plaque to reduce the risk of embolic stroke in patients with ICA stenosis between 60 and 90%. May be performed:
* Under GA
* Under regional anaesthesia  
Allows neurological monitoring, but requires:
	* Surgeon comfort
	* Patient compliance

##Considerations
* A
	* LMA may reduce carotid blood flow - consider using ETT.
	* Head is inaccessible during surgery
* C
	* Co-existing CVS disease
	* Accurate measurement of normal BP  
	Measure in both arms, and target the highest intraoperatively.
* D
	* Use of cerebral monitoring
	* CVA recency  
	Reperfusion within **one month** of the original infarct may lead to haemorrhagic transformation of ischaemic brain.
	* Regional technique  
	Involves:
		* Choice of anaesthesia  
		Usually combination of superficial and deep cervical plexus block, but may include:
			* Layered block  
			Local field block performed in each dissection plane by the surgeon.
				* Useful as a rescue for failed block
			* Cervical epidural  
			Rarely performed.
			* Superficial cervical plexus block
				* Does not provide muscular relaxation
			* Deep cervical plexus block
				* Provides muscle relaxation
				* Greater incidence of complications



##Preparation
* Standard ANZCA monitoring
* 5-lead ECG
* Arterial line  
Transduce at the level of the EAM.
* Bilateral blood pressure monitoring

##Induction
* Haemodynamically stable induction

##Intraoperative
Patient comfort in regional technique:
* Judicious conscious sedation
	* Propofol TCI
	* Clonidine  
	1μg/kg, then 1μg/kg/hr.
* Continual communication
* Use of a non-heated mattress
* Padding and support of all pressure areas
* Ensure bladder emptied
* Minimise IVT to prevent need to void
* Water to wet the lips appropriate, but drinking may precipitate choking/coughing/aspiration, and is to be avoided

###Surgical Stages
Can be divided into three stages:
* Exposure
	* Oblique neck incision
	* Division of common facial vein
	* Exposure of carotid artery
	* Control of common carotid, internal carotid, and external carotid
	* Administration of **heparin**

* Clamping	
Sequential clamping of internal, external, and common carotid arteries
	* Clamping of internal carotid may significantly reduce cerebral perfusion
	* Evidence of impaired cerebral perfusion should be managed surgically with placement of a shunt
	* Consider use of cerebral perfusion monitoring  
		* **Regional techniques**  
		Deficits may present as:
			* Immediate unconsciousness upon clamping
			* Immediate subtle deficit
			* Delayed deficient  
			Typically related to hypoperfusion.
		* **Stump pressure**  
			Indicates efficacy of cerebral perfusion. Ischaemia is rare when stump pressure is **>40mmHg**.
		* Cerebral oximetry  
		Non-quantitative.
		* Regional CBF  
		Generally unavailable.

	* Aim MAP **greater than highest recorded awake level** during clamping  
	Consider **⩾20% above baseline** to reduce POCD.
	* Stimulation of **carotid baroreceptors** may lead to sudden haemodynamic instability  
	Anticipate sudden ↓ HR or ↓ BP.
	* Consider use of neuroprotective agents to achieve burst-suppression
	* Note total clamping time on record

* Emergence
	* Avoid hypertension during extubation
	* Deep extubation appropriate
