#Complex Regional Pain Syndrome

Chronic pain condition defined by:
* Continuing pain that is **disproportionate** to any inciting event
* Pain that is **regional**  
Not specific to a dermatome or peripheral nerve territory.
* With at least one finding from the following:
	* Sensory  
	Hyperaesthesia, allodynia.
	* Motor/tropic  
	Decreased range of motion or motor dysfunction.
	* Sudomotor  
	Oedema, sweating changes, asymmetry.
	* Vasomotor  
	Asymmetry in temperature or skin colour, or skin colour changes.
	* Trophic findings
* No other diagnosis that explains the symptoms


CRPS is divided into two subtypes:
* Type I  
No evidence of nerve injury.
* Type II  
Evidence of nerve injury present.

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Key risk factors:
* Female > Male
* Post-fracture

##Pathophysiology
Poorly understood, but multifactorial process involving central and peripheral nervous systems:

###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
> * Non-pharmacological treatment is first line
> * Limited evidence for any particular therapy. Goals are to:
> 	* Restore function
> 	* Decrease pain and disability
> 	* Improve quality of life


Prevention:
* Avoid prolonged immobilisation
* Vitamin C 500mg daily
* Minimise tourniquet time


Non-pharmacological:
* Graded Motor Imagery
* Mirror therapy
* Physiotherapy
* Occupational therapy


Pharmacological:
* Oral corticosteroids
* Gabapentinoids
* Antidepressants
* Bisphosphonates


Refractory:
* Sympathetic nerve blocks
* Spinal cord stimulators
* Dorsal root ganglia stimulation
