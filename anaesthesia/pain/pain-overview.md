#Pain

Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Pain is:
* Distinct from nociception  
Process of nervous system transmission of a noxious stimuli.
* Divided into:
	* Acute pain
	* Chronic pain  
	Pain lasting beyond the time expected for healing following an injury, occurring due to changes in both peripheral and central nervous systems, as well as psychologically.



##Pain Management
Pain management is important as pain:
* Causes suffering
* Limits rehabilitation  
Adequate analgesia facilitates **restoration** of **normal function**.
* Leads to secondary complications
	* Catecholamine release
		* ↑ MVO<sub>2</sub>  
		Ischaemia.
		* Fatigue
	* Stasis
		* Atelectasis/pneumonia
		* DVT
		* Catabolic state
	* Progresses to chronic pain



###Goals of Pain Management
Goals of pain management include:
* ↓ Pain initiation
* Inhibit neurotransmission
* Prevent sensitisation
	* Central
	* Peripheral
* Psychological preparation
	* Set expectations
	* Control pain


##Pain Assessment
> Use the **PASS** assessment:
>	* Pain history
>	* Analgesia and other drug substances
>	* Stress and other psychology
>	* Surgical factors


Key components of a pain history include:
* Site
	* Location
	* Radiation
* Circumstances  
Associated trauma, procedures.
* Character  
Key descriptors.
* Intensity  
Including:
	* At rest
	* With movement
	* Temporal factors
		* Duration
		* Intensity over time
		* Continuous or intermittent
	* Aggravating or relieving factors
* Associated symptoms
* Effect of pain on:
	* Activities of daily living
	* Sleep
* Treatment
	* Current and previous medications
		* Doses
		* Frequency of use
		* Efficacy
		* Adverse effects
	* Other treatment
	* Health professionals consulted
* Relevant medical history
* Factors influencing patients symptomatic treatment
	* Belief around cause
	* Knowledge, expectations, and preferences for management
	* Expected outcome
	* Reduction in pain required for patient satisfaction
	* Coping responses
	* Family expectations



##Mechanism Based Approach
> Key terms:
> 	* Preventative analgesia  
>	Analgesic effect lasts longer than expected duration of drug effet.
> 	* Preemptive analgesia  
>	Analgesia provided prior to nociceptive stimulus.


Targeting:
* Somatic pain
* Visceral pain
* Neuropathic pain


* Perioperative IV lignocaine reduces pain and opioid requirement
* Dexamethasone reduces post-operative pain, as well as PONV and fatigue
* Calcitonin reduces acute (not chronic) phantom limb pain
* No evidence supporting use of cannabinoids
* Paracetamol given pre- and intraoperatively reduces PONV and improves analgesia, but does ont reduce opioids
* Gabapentin and pregabalin are opioid-sparing
* Calcitonin reduces acute phantom limb pain


NSAIDs:
* Spectrum of activity between COX-1 and COX-2
* Renal injury is low when used appropriately
* Cardiac risk is:
	* Greater with COX-2s
	* Appears dose-related
	* Increased in patients without diagnosed cardiac disease
* Naproxen has a lower risk of myocardial injury than other NSAIDs
* Non-selective NSAIDs may increase risk of bleeding in tonsillectomy
* COX-2 inhibitors do not affect bone healing in humans


Epidural Analgesia:
* Provides better analgesia than system opioids, irrespective of patient or surgery type
* Reduces incidence of respiratory failure after major surgery in high risk patients  
NNT 15.
* Safe
	* Epidural haematoma is vanishingly rare
	* Epidural abscesses  
	Most likely to track from skin: significantly reduced with chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings.


Opioids:
> Do not use long-acting opioids in high-risk patients

* Highly effective for somatic pain  
Act pre-synaptically and post-synaptically at multiple points.
* Poor control of visceral pain
* OIVI  
Particularly in high-risk groups.
	* Sedation
	* ↓ Oropharyngeal tone
	* Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> set point


Methadone:
* Old, synthetic, and cheap
* Long elimination half-life
* Beneficial for NMDA receptor antagonism
* 0.2mg/kg at induction reduces PCA use by 48 hours in spinal surgery


Ketamine:
* Preventive analgesic effect
* Opioid sparing
* Reduces PONV  
In thoracics.
* May be useful in opioid-resistant pain


Tramadol:
* Mixed receptor activity
* Relatively high NNT
* Minimal improvement in pain score, but better subjective opinion of pain


α2-delta ligands:
* α2-delta ligands  
Probably little in most patients, but good in opioid tolerant.
* Avoid using PRN

Clonidine  
* Useful in opioid users.


PCAs:
* Improve analgesia
* Improve patient satisfaction
* Increase opioid consumption


Other:
* Avoid withdrawal of benzodiazepines
