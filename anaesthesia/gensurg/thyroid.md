#Thyroidectomy
>Airway: ETT <br>
>Access: ~18G IV <br>
>Pain: Simple analgesia and PRN opioid usually adequate <br>
>Position: Supine with neck extended. <br>
>Time: 1-3 hours. <br>
>Blood loss: Low. <br>
>Special: Use of intraoperative nerve monitoring for laryngeal nerve preservation requires use of a specialised ETT, and absence of muscle relaxation. <br>


Removal of thyroid gland, usually by transverse neck incision. Performed for:
* Cancer
	* Adenomas
* Goitre

##Considerations
* A
	* Goitre
		* Retrosternal
			* >50% of goitres are retrosterenal  
			Associated with increased rate of complications.
			* 90% have airway issues
			* 1/3rd have dysphagia.
	* Tracheomalacia
	* Airway plan  
	Particularly afterwards. Plan for:
		* Minimising coughing
		* Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy
* B
	* Obesity
* C
	* AF or CHF  
	If hyperthyroid.
* D
	* Use of nerve monitoring
* E
	* Thyroid state  
	Aim euthyroid if possible. Evaluate for:
		* Normal temperature
		* Normal HR, BP, pulse pressure
		* Normal reflexes
	* Electrolytes  
	Notably **hypocalcaemia**.


##Preparation
##Induction
* Standard induction
* Shorter acting neuromuscular blockers should be used if using nerve integrity monitoring

##Intraoperative
* Ensure depth of anaesthesia adequate, particularly if incompletely treated hyperthyroidism


###Surgical Stages
* Skin incision
* Platsyma divided
* Subplatysmal flaps developed
	* Anterior jugular veins avoided
* Prethyroid fascia divided in midline


* Thyroid gland resected  
Depends on diagnosis.
	* Total
	* Subtotal  
	Lobe, isthmus, +/- part of remaining lobe.
	* Lobar
* Identification and preservation of the:
	* Parathyroid glands
	* Recurrent laryngeal nerve(s)
* Excision of lymph nodes

##Postoperative
Immediate serious post-operative complications include:
* Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage
	* Bilateral  
	Vocal cords adducted.
		* Unable to speak
		* Requires reintubation  
		CPAP may temporise by splinting open cords.
	* Unilateral  
	Hoarse voice.
* Tracheomalacia  
Acute upper airway obstuction due to tracheal collapse.
	* Requires emergent reintubation or tracheostomy
	* Largely a historical remant  
	Risk is exceedingly rare in modern practice.
	* Risks may include:
		* Duration of goitre
		* Retrosternal extension of goitre
		* Significance of extrinsic compression  
		Tumour; may also include bronchogenic carcinoma or aortic aneurysm.
* Haematoma  
Expansion may lead to airway compromise.
	* Rapidly reopen incision and drain remaining blood
	* Consider CPAP to temporise airway
	* Reintubation may be required immediately, or delayed (on return to theatre)

Delayed complications include:
* Hypoparathyroidism  
Inadvertent removal of parathyroid glands leading to acute fall in PTH and hypocalcaemia:
	* Presents as:
		* Laryngeal stridor
		* Tingling/numbness
		* Tetany
		* Seizures
	* Treated with 10ml calcium gluconate IV
