Approaches and management depend on location:
* Ascending  
May be either:
	* Valve Sparing (David's Procedure)  
	With or without coronary re-implantation.
	* Valve Replacement (Bentall Procedure)
* Arch  
Most complex legion due to requirement for debranching and reimplantation of arch vessels. Cerebroprotection performed with:
	* Retrograde cerebral perfusion
	* Hypothermic circulatory arrest
* Descending  
Usually performed:
	* Via left posterolateral thoracotomy
	* Partial or full CPB

##Considerations

			* Marfan's Syndrome  
			Ascending aneurysms.
			* Degenerative
				* Atherosclerosis
				* HTN
				* Syphilis
				* Cystic medial necrosis
* D
	* CVA  
	High incidence of CVA with aortic surgery. Consider:
		* NIRS
