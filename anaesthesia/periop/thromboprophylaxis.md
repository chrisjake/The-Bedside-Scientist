#Thromboprophylaxis

VTE is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the surgical population


##Risk Assessment
> * Patients should be risk stratified so VTE prevention methods are used appropriately


Must factor in:
* Risk of **thrombosis versus** risk of **bleeding**
* Surgical factors  
Major determinant.
* Patient factors

###Thrombosis Risk Prediction
> Prediction models exist (e.g. CAPRINI) but is complex and has limited validation, limiting uptake




###Bleeding Risk Prediction


##Management
According to risk:
* Very low VTE risk
