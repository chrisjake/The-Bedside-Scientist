#Perioperative Cardiac Evaluation and Management

##Preoperative Management
Involves:
* Risk Stratification

##Risk Stratification
> Patients ⩾45 years of age, or 18-44 with known significant cardiac disease are most likely to benefit from thorough pre-operative risk assessment

Pre-operatively:
* All patients should have cardiac risk assessed
* Assess functional capacity with the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI)  
Useful thresholds:
	* Personal ADLs  
	1 MET.
	* Walk up a flight of stairs or on level ground at 6km/hr  
	4 METS.
	* Do heavy housework or two flights of stairs  
	4-10 METS.
	* Strenuous sports  
	>10 METS.
* Can be performed using either:
	* **Revised Cardiac Risk Index** (RCRI)
		* Evaluates six major risk factors:
			* High risk surgery
			* IHD  
			Evidenced by MI, positive stress test, ischaemic CP, nitrate use, ECG with Q waves.
			* Cardiac failure
			* Cerebrovascular disease
			* DM on insulin
			* Cr ⩾177μmol/L
		* Calculates risk of:
			* Cardiac death, MI, cardiac arrest:
				* 0 risk factors: 0.4%
				* 1 risk factor: 1%
				* 2 risk factors: 2.4%
				* ⩾3 risk factors: 5.4%
			* Rate of MI, pulmonary oedema, VF, cardiac arrest, CHB:
				* 0 risk factors: 0.5%
				* 1 risk factor: 1.3%
				* 2 risk factors: 3.6%
				* ⩾3 risk factors: 9.1%
	* National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)
* Dividing patients into:
	* Low risk  
	⩽1% chance of perioperative MI.
	* High risk
		* Consider:
			* Echocardiography  
			Presence of significant LV systolic dysfunction or severe valvular disease is associated with a worse outcome.
			* Stress testing
			* Cardiology consultation
		* Monitoring troponin should be considered perioperatively   
		Pre-operatively, as well as 24 and 72 hours post-operatively.

Investigations:
* NT-proBNP/BNP  
	* Independently associated with death and nonfatal MI at 30 days after non-cardiac surgery  
	* BNP >92mg/L or NT-proBNP >300ng/L  
	22% vs 4.9%.



###CAD/IHD
*Management of perioperative stents is covered under [antiplatelets in coronary artery stents](/anaesthesia/periop/periop-antiplatelet.md#pci).*


Previous MI:
* ⩾60 days should elapse after MI before non-cardiac surgery performed, in absence of coronary intervention
* MI within **6 months** is an independent risk factor for perioperative stroke  
8x increase in mortality.


Angiography:
* Routine perioperative angiography is not recommended
* Revascularisation only recommended if indicated by other existing guidelines
* No difference in long-term outcome with revascularisation unless:
	* Left main disease
	* LVEF <20%
	* Severe AS



###Heart Failure
Perioperative evaluation of LV function is reasonable in patients with:
* Dyspnoea of unknown origin
* Worsening dyspnoea or change in clinical status
* No assessment of LV function in previous 12 months


Risk prediction:
* LVEF <30% is an independent contributor to perioperative morbidity


##Arrhythmia
General principles:
* AF  
Adjust anticoagulation as required.
* Ventricular ectopics don't require intervention unless:
	* Associated with structural abnormality
	* Symptomatic
* Frequent ventricular ectopics are a risk factor for arrhythmia but not MI or death
* VT should be evaluated by a cardiologist
	* LV function
	* CAD


##Post-Operative


###Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery
MINS is:
* Defined as elevated cardiac troponin ⩾99<sup>th</sup> percentile
* Likely a supply-demand mismatch in the majority of cases
* Complicates 8-19% of non-cardiac surgery
	* 40% of these are true MI
* Associated with significant increase in short and long-term perioperative mortality  
22.5% vs 9.3%.

Screening:
* Should be performed in high risk patients   
Defined as:
	* RCRI >1%
	* Elevated NT-proBNP/BNP
	* Age 45-64 with significant VBS disease
	* Age >75
* Pre-operatively: Troponin and ECG
* Repeat ECG in PACU
* Repeat high-sensitivity troponin at 6-12 hours, and on days 1-3

Management of myocardial injury without MI:
* Aspirin
* Statin
* Consideration of beta-blockade
