#Perioperative Management

###Respiratory Management
* Smoking should cease prior to OT if possible
	* At least 4 weeks
	* Ideally over 8 weeks
	* Abstaining 24/24 prior may still have benefit
* OSA should be:
	* Screened for
	* Managed perioperatively with CPAP
	* 

###Cardiac Management
* Patients should be risk-stratified by the RCRI
* Monitoring troponin should be considered perioperatively in high risk patients having major surgery  
Pre-operatively, as well as 24 and 72 hours post-operatively.


###Renal Management
* Identify patients at risk for AKI and aim to mitigage these risk factors
	* Maintain volume state
	* Avoid nephrotoxins
	* Maintain adequate renal perfusion

##Haematological Management
* Identify patients with high bleeding risk
	* History
	* Platelet counts
	* Coagulation assays
* Anaemia  
Defined as Hb < 120 g/L for women and < 130 g/L for men.
	* Iron deficiency anaemia should be treated with IV iron transfusion
	* EPO supplementation should be used pre-operatively when other causes of anaemia are excluded/treated
* TXA should be used in anaemic patients
* Cell salvage should be used for orthopaedic procedurers with high anticipated blood loss


##Medicine Management
* Drugs which should be **ceased perioperatively**
	* OHGs  
	Morning of surgery.
	* Antidepressants  
	Morning of surgery.
* Drugs which should be **adjusted perioperatively**
	* Insulins
	* Anticoagulants
	* Antiplatelets
		* Aspirin  
		Cease 7 days preoperatively if bleeding risk outweights potential CVS benefit. This includes:
			* Spinal surgery
			* Some neurosurgery
			* Some opthalmic surgery
	* Steroids
	* Bronchodilators  
	Give preoperatively.
* Drugs which should be **initiated perioperatively**
	* Beta-blockade  
	Consider starting atenolol or bisoprolol for patients undergoing **high risk** surgery **and**:
		* Two RCRI risk factors
		* ASA 3+
		* Known IHD or ischaemia
		In increased risk of stroke, inducible ischaemia, CAD, multiple CVS risk factors.
		* Note that cardioselective β-blockers do not increase bronchospasm risk in short term
