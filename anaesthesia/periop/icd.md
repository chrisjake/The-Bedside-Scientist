#Perioperative Management of Implantable Cardiac Devices

Implantable cardiac devices include:
* Pacemakers  
Generate an electrical impulse to stimulate myocardial contraction. Used for:
	* Bradycardic states
	* Resynchronisation
* Defibrillators  
Used for primary or secondary prevention of VT, in patients with:
	* Severe LV dysfunction
	* Post-MI
	* Sudden cardiac death syndromes
* Implantable Loop Recorders  
Diagnostic tool used in recurrent unexplained syncope.

##Risks
Include:
* Electromechanical interference  
External electrical stimuli (e.g. due to diathermy) may interfere with pacemaker function in two ways:
	* Over-sensing  
	The pacemaker interprets EMI as intrinsic activity, and does not pace despite the intrinsic rhythm being inadequate. This:
		* Will result in the underlying rhythm being the actual rhythm  
		Extent of haemodynamic compromise depends on the nature of the underlying rhythm.
	* Under-sensing  
	Pacemaker does not detect intrinsic activity, and paces over an intrinsic rhythm. This:
		* Leads to over-pacing
		* May cause **malignant arrhythmias** as if an R-on-T occurs


##Clinical Manifestations
Includes both:
* Nature of surgery
* Device assessment

###Surgery Assessment
EMI risk of the surgery is based upon:
* Requirement for unipolar diathermy
* Location  
Closer to heart or pacing leads is increased risk.

###Device Assessment
Evaluation of pacemakers should consider:
* Last pacing check  
Within **12 months**.
* Indication for pacing
* Dependency on pacing  
What proportion of time is the patient actively paced.
* Underlying cardiac activity  
No underlying activity, or a non-perfusing rhythm, is at higher risk.
* Pacing threshold  
Amplitude should be at least double the threshold.
* Lead impedance  
High impedance suggests damage, excessively low impedance suggests insulation defect.
* Battery life
* Single or biventricular pacing  
Biventricular pacing is used for cardiac resynchronisation therapy, and suggests the patient has HFrEF.
* Presence of rate-responsive pacing modes  
Pacemaker detects a certain event (usually motion, implying exertion) and increases paced rate to compensate.
* Magnet mode effect  
Usually places the devices into DOO or VOO at a set rate.
* ECG
	* Pacing dependency
	* Pacing capture
* CXR
	* Lead placement
	* Number of leads
	* Presence of ICD  
	Identified by use of shock coils on lead and a capacitor in the device.


Evaluation of AICDs should consider:
* Last pacing check  
Within **6 months**.
* Indication
* Magnet mode effect  
Usually disables the ICD.



##Management


###Pre-operative
* Measure and correct electrolytes
* Continue prescribed anti-arrhythmics
* Consider re-programming device if:
	* Significant pacemaker dependency exists
	* Advanced functions need to be adjusted
		* Sleep/rest mode  
		Fall in HR and CO overnight, if late surgery is planned.
		* Disable minute ventilation based rate-responsiveness
	* Defibrillator function present

###Intraoperative
Anaesthesia:
* Standard monitoring
* C
	* Have defibrillation equipment available
	* Consider induction with pads on if high risk
	* Consider arterial line
	* Consider cardiac output monitor
* D
	* Nerve stimulators can be used if:
		* Distant from the device
		* Stimulus is not parallel to pacemaker circuit
* E
	* Avoid suxamethonium


Surgery:
* Use bipolar diathermy if possible
* If using unipolar diathermy:
	* Ensure the return path does not cross the ICD
	* Use in short (1-2s) bursts
	* Use cutting rather than coagulation
* Have a magnet available


###Post-operative
* Reactivate any disabled functions
* Check the device if a magnet has been used
