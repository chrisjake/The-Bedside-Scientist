#Considerations in Paediatric Anaesthesia
*This section covers various considerations for paediatric anaesthesia. The [anaesthetic assessment of a paediatric patient](/assessment/anaesthetic/paeds.md) is covered elsewhere.*

This section covers, by system, the differences from adults relevant to paediatric anaesthesia.

##Airway
Children **under 4** have different airway anatomy which may hamper airway management:
* Relatively large:
	* Head
	* Tongue
		* Difficult to negotiate with laryngoscopy
		* ↑ Risk of upper airway obstruction
		* Obligate nasal breathing in first few weeks of life  
			* ↑ Risk of obstruction with:
				* Nasal congestion
				* Foreign body
					* Nasal prongs
					* NGT
	* Epiglottis  
	May cover laryngeal inlet if laryngoscope is engaged in the vallecula - hence use of straight blades to elevate epiglottis.
* Relatively small mandible
* Prominent occiput
* Short neck and trachea
	* High risk of both endobronchial intubation and inadvertent extubation  
	Endobronchial intubation may be eithe left- or right-sided, as both main bronchi divert at the same angle.
* Higher larynx  
Results in relatively anterior laryngx.

###Post-Extubation "Croup"{#stridor}
Post-operative laryngeal oedema due to irritation from ETT. It:
* Can be **disastrous**
* Occurs in young children due to airway diameter
	* 1-4 years
	* Infants ⩽1 at particular risk
* Presents as stridor and coughing
* Requires immediate treatment with:
	* Humidified oxygen  
	FiO<sub>2</sub> >0.5.
	* Resuscitation
	* Light sedation  
	Aim to reduce distress without decreasing respiratory drive.
	* Nebulised adrenaline
	* Steroids  
	Dexamethasone 0.5-1mg/kg.
	* Reintubation  
	If ongoing deterioration or hypoxia.
	* Tracheostomy  
	If upper airway obstruction worsens.
* Rebound may occur at ~2 hours


##Respiratory
Key differences:
* ↓ Airway diameter  
ETT diameter significantly affects airway resistance.
* Anatomically inefficient alignment of thoracic bones, and weak respiratory musculature
	* Less efficient ventilation  
	Reliant on diaphragm as bucket-handle mechanism not functional.
	* ↓ Respiratory reserve
	* Earlier onset of respiratory failure due to fatigue
	* ↑ Chest wall compliance  
	Early apperance of intercostal and sternal recession when work of breathing is ↑.
* ↓ Number of thick-walled alveoli  
May only be 10% of adult total.
* Notably **similar tidal volume** of 7mL/kg
* Similar **dead space volume**  
However apparatus dead space becomes proportionally more important.
* ↑ VA:FRC ratio  
Change in inspired gas mixture rapidly alters alveolar (and arterial) gas composition.
	* Rapid uptake of volatile agents
* Higher closing volume (until 6-12 months) and reduced FRC  
	* ↑ Risk of atelectasis
	* ↑ Risk of shunt
	* Rapid desaturation 
* Immature respiratory centres
	* Periodic breathign with apnoeas in neonates
	* Sub-anaesthetic drug concentrations still affect respiration

##Cardiovascular
Key differences:
* ↓ Myocardial compliance  
Heart failure with ↑ volume due to poor Starling response.
* ↓ Contractility  
Due to ↓ number of elements.
	* Fixed stroke volume
	* CO is HR dependent
* Heart rate
	* Bradycardia is poorly tolerated  
	HR <60 does not give adequate CO - **commence CPR**.
	* Tachycardia is well tolerated
* Dominate vagal tone  
Bradycardia common with vagal stimuli, such as laryngoscopy, hypoxia.

##CNS
Covers both:
* Anatomical
* Functional

###Anatomical
* Incomplete blood-brain barrier  
Free passage of:
	* Opioids
	* Barbiturates
	* Bilirubin
* Open sutures and large anterior fontanelle
	* Can be used to evaluate presence of ↑ ICP
	* Sutures will open and fontanelle expand prior to ↑ in ICP
* Greater volume of CSF
	* Subarachnoid anaesthesia requires higher doses, and does not last as long
* Spinal cord occupies entire length of canal  
Canal and cord grow at different rates, so the termination moves cephalad with age:
	* S1 at 28 weeks
	* L3 at term
	* L2/3 at 1 year
	* L1/2 at 8
* Incomplete ossification of sacral vertebrae  
Neuraxial techniques achievable.


###Psychological
Developmental stages:
* Have a significant effect on the:
	* Behaviour of the child
	* Strategies to faciltiate anaesthesia
* Include:
	* Birth to 6 months:
		* Parental anxiety > infant anxiety
		* Separation tolerated  
		Provided a surrogate mother provided.
		* Anxiolytic unnecessary
	* 6 months to 4 years:
		* Separation anxiety
		* Fear of environment common
		* Aware that this is not normal
		* Anxiolysis helpful
	* 4 to 6 years:
		* Fear of strangers  
		Ongoing separation anxiety, but may be less than previous.
		* May understand simple explanations
		* Anxiolysis helpful
	* 6 to 13 years:
		* Existential concerns (death, self-control) more common
		* Anxiolysis may be helpful

Significant anxiety is common to both children and parents around time of surgery:
* Parental anxiety is:
	* Common
	* Often exaggerated understanding of risk
* Child anxiety is common, and exacerbated by:
	* Lack of understanding
	* Lack of cooperation


##Musculoskeletal
Sensitivity to hypothermia due to:
* ↑ Surface area:volume ratio  
↑ Heat losses to environment, and in respiratory vapour (due to higher MV).
* ↓ Heat production  
Weaker compensatory mechanisms:
	* Ineffective shivering
	* Poor vasoconstriction  
	Ineffective A-V shunts.
	* Non-shivering thermogenesis  
	Brown fat metabolism key to heat production.

###Mechanisms of Reduce Heat Loss during Surgery
Reduce:
* Unncessary exposure


Increase warming with:
* Radiant heaters
* Warm fluids
	* Intravenous
	* Irrigation
	* Skin preparation
* Active warmers
* Adjust operating theatre temperature
	* 20-22°C for children
	* 26-28°C for neonates
* Humidified ventilators
	* Circle system with HME
	* Inspiratory humidifiers

##Renal
**Neonates and infants** have:
* ↓ Tubular concentrating ability
* ↓ Renal bicarbonate levels
* ↓ GFR  
Reduced ability to cope with volume and electrolyte loads.

##Hepatic
Key differences up to **~2-3 months**:
* Immature metabolic pathways
	* Many drugs  
	May prolong post-operative effects, and alter dosage intervals or infusion rates.
	* Bilirubin

Key differences in **neonates**:
* Reduced vitamin K dependent clotting factors in neonate
* Reduced glucose storage in neonate
	* Hypoglycaemia common if not feeding

##Pharmacological
Key differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics occur in children up to ~6 months.

###Pharmacokinetic
* Absorption
	* Reduced IM and SC absorption
* Distribution  
	* Rapid distribution due to high CO
	* ↑ TBW and V<sub>d</sub> of water-soluble drugs
	* ↑ ECF compartment volume  
	Increases required dosing for drugs distributed to ECF.
	* ↓ Plasma protein level and protein binding  
	Increases free drug fraction.
	* Poorly developed blood-brain barrier  
	↑ CNS distribution of drugs. 
* Metabolism
	* Immature hepatic metabolism
* Elimination
	* Immature renal function
