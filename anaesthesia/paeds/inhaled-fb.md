Intro and technique

##Considerations
* Stability of the foreign body
* Surgeon available with rigid bronch
* Spont vent


##Preparation
##Induction
> Priority is to **maintain spontaneous ventilation**

Suggested approach:
* Perform a gas induction with sevoflurane
* Place IV rapidly
* Begin propofol TCI at 1μg/ml
* Commence remifentanil at 0.2μg/kg/min  
With bolus to cover dead space of line.
* Half sevoflurane (to 4%)
* Increase propofol TCI to 1.5μg/ml
* Continue to increase propofol target every 30-60s until at 2.5-3μg/ml
* Turn sevoflurane off
* Give cophenylcaine
* Spray lignocaine 4mg/kg
	* 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of volume above cords
	* 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of volume below cords
* Oxygenate
	* Via rigid bronchoscopy
	* Via face mask
	* Via high-flow humidified nasal oxygen

##Intraoperative
* Give 0.25mg/kg dexamethasone
* *Consider* fentanyl up to 2μg/kg  
Give slowly to prevent apnoea.
* Titrate propofol to respiratory rate
* Can bolus remifentanil 0.5μg/kg if ongoing airway reactivity  
Usually remifentanil rate remains constant.
* **Regular topicalisation**  
2mg/kg lignocaine Q20-25 minutes.

###Surgical Stages
Insertion of rigid bronchoscope:
* Attach T-piece to side arm of rigid bronchoscopy OR
* Use high-flow humidified oxygen
* Remember to re-topicalise periodically

Ventilation:
* Keep a hand on the chest during rigid bronchoscopy to monitor respiratory rate  
No ETCO<sub>2</sub> or gas monitor available.
	* Patient may become
		* Too light  
		Breath holds, stridor.
		* Too deep  
		Preceded by bradycardia, bradypnoea.
