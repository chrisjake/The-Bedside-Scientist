#Univentricular Pathway

Describes a general operative pathway for congenital cardiac disease that:
* Enables survival and growth
* Occurs in three stages
	* Norwood at day 1-3
	* 
* Ends in a [Fontan Circulation](/management/cvs/fontan.md)
* May be performed for the following:
	* Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
	* Pulmonary Atresia with VSD
	* Tricuspid atresia
	* Ebstein's Anomaly
	* Atrioventricular Septal Defect
	* Double-Inlet Left Ventricle
	* Double-Outlet Right Ventricle


##Norwood Procedure
The Norwood:
* Aims to provide a reliable blood supply to support growth and development
* Occurs at day 1-3 of life  
Sickness at birth is dependent on:
	* Degree of atrial mixing
	* Patency of the ductus arteriosus
	* Qp:Qs ratio

###Preoperative Management
* B
	* Maintain PVR  
	Required to achieve adequate systemic flow and prevent a pulmonary steal. Aim:
		* Normal to high-normal PCO<sub>2</sub>
		* **SpO<sub>2</sub> 80-85%**  
		May be achieved with hypoxic gas mixtures, if required.
	* Decreased FiO<sub>2</sub>
	* IPPV may be required  
	Due to apnoea from PGE<sub>1</sub>.
* C
	* PGE<sub>1</sub> infusion  
	Prevents ductus arteriosus from closing.
	* Inotropes  
	Augmentation of ventricular function.


###Surgical Stages
Involves:
* Closure of ductus arteriosus
* Formation of a neo-aorta  
Through joining of the pulmonary artery and the aorta; the Damus-Kay-Stansel procedure.
* Formation of a systemic-pulmonary artery shunt  
Results in supra-normal pulmonary flow. May be:
	* Right modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt (RMBTS)  
	Shunt placed between right subclavian artery and right pulmonary artery.
		* Right because it is on the right side
		* Modified because it uses goretex, rather than a direct side-to-side anastomosis
	* Central shunt
	* RV-PA conduit  
	A Sano shunt.
* Atrial septectomy  
Formation of a common atria.


##Bi-Directional Cavo-Pulmonary Connection/Shunt (The Glenn Procedure)
The BDCPC/S:
* Aims to begin offloading of the RV
	* Avoiding pulmonary hypertension associated with the supra-normal flow following the Norwood
* Occurs at month 2-6 of life


###Surgical Stages
Involves:
* Connecting SVC to PA
* Removal of the systemic-PA shunt

###Postoperative
* Pulmonary flow is dependent on SVC VR
* Systemic ventricle preload is a function of both:
	* Pulmonary flow
	* IVC VR


##Fontan
*Management of the Fontan circulation is covered [elsewhere](/management/cvs/fontan.md)*.

The Fontan procedure:
* Is the last step in the single-ventricle pathway
* Aims to offload the heart and establish a separate pulmonary circulation

###Surgical Stages
Involves creation of:
* An IVC to right PA conduit
* A 4mm fenestration  
Allows right-to-left shunting to occur, which:
	* Prevents development of pulmonary hypertension
	* Reduces venous congestion and the associated complications
	* Ensures some ventricular filling is maintained, even if PVR is transiently elevated
	* Leads to post-operative SpO<sub>2</sub> of ~89%
