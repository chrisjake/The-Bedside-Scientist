#Perioperative Evaluation of Paediatric Heart Murmurs

Heart murmurs in the paediatric patient are:
* Common  
50-85% of children may have a heart murmur.
* Usually innocent  


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Congenital cardiac disease:
* Increases mortality in non-cardiac surgery by 2x  
Major risk factors:
	* Cyanosis
	* Younger age
	* Complex defect
	* Comorbidities
	* Heart failure

##Assessment
History:
* Toxins  
Pre- and peri-natal exposure to:
	* Alcohol
	* Lithium
* Infections
* Maternal diabetes
* Prematurity
* Family history of:
	* Sudden cardiac death
	* Cardiac disease
	* Sudden infant death
	* Congenital cardiac disease

Should include:
* Palpation of pulses
	* Assess for equality and delay
* Palpation of thrills
* Evaluation of features of murmur
* Features of right heart failure

Key symptoms include:
* B
	* Recurrent chest infections
	* Cyanosis
	* Tachypnoea
* C
	* Decreased exercise tolerance/constitutional symptoms
		* Failure to thrive
		* Feeding difficulties
		* Diaphoresis
		* Fatigue
	* Squatting posture during play  
	Suggests ToF spells.
	* Syncope
	* Oedema  
	Usually peri-ocular.
* D
	* Developmental delay




##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
Differentiating Pathological and Non-Pathological Murmurs:

|Finding|Innocent Murmurs|Pathological Murmurs|
|**Symptoms**|Asymptomatic|Symptomatic|
|**Timing**|Early systolic or continuous|Diastolic pansystolic, or late systolic|
|**Quality**|Blowing, "musical"|Variable/harsh|
|**Thrill**|Never|Potential|
|**Postural Variation**|Common|Rare|


##Investigations
ECG:
* Evaluate evidence of ventricular hypertrophy

##Management
Factors favouring postponement and paediatric cardiology involvement:
* Patients <1 year  
Severe pathology may be present in absence of symptoms.
* Symptomatic patients
* Syndromic patients

Factors favouring proceeding with surgery prior to evaluation:
* Asymptomatic
* Age ⩾ 1 year
* Normal ECG
