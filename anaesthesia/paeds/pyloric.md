Pyloromyotomy is:
* Performed for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis  
Leads to gastric outflow obstruction.
* Incision of hypertrophied muscle down to the mucosa
* Curative

Patients classically are:
* 1 to 3 months old  
May be as young as 5 days.
* White
* Male  
80%.
* Projectile vomiting of gastric contents (no bile)
* Alkalotic  
Hypokalaemic hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis.
* Diagnosed clinically 
'Olive' palpable epigastrically and right of midline.

##Considerations
* A
	* Aspiration risk  
	High risk - OGT or NGT should be placed and stomach suctioned prior to induction.
		* Four-quadrant suctioning can be performed
* C
	* Volume state  
	Must be corrected preoperatively.
* F
	* Alkalosis
		* Off-loading of oxygen is impaired in alkalotic states  
		More important in neonates due to foetal haemoglobin level.
		* Compensatory respiratory acidosis is common  
		Extent of compensation (i.e. PaCO<sub>2</sub>) is a marker of severity of dehyration.
		* Respiratory alkalosis (secondary to hypovolaemic shock) suggests **critical** dehydration
	* Hyponatraemia  
	May be present but masked by dehydration.


##Preoperative Assessment
> Surgery is not an emergency and electrolyte and fluid state should be corrected prior to operating

Evaluation should consider:
* Frequency and extent of vomiting
* Volume and electrolyte status  
	* Volume loss:
		* Frequency and amount of vomiting
		* Diarrhoea
		* Urine output
	* Resuscitation performed:  
	Adequate resuscitation may take up to 72 hours.
		* Inital resuscitation of shock with standard solutions
		CSL or Albumin.
		* Correct volume with salt and dextrose containing solutions  
			* Usually requires addition of potassium 40mmol/L
		* HCl may be used to correct severe alkalosis but is rarely necessary

##Preparation
* Secure IV access
* Monitoring required
	* SpO<sub>2</sub>
	* ECG
	* Blood pressure
* Ensure stomach has been aspirated  
Premedicate with atropine (0.02mg/kg) prior to decompressoin.

##Induction
* Rapid sequence induction
* Avoid opioids to reduce risk of post-operative respiratory depression

##Intraoperative
* Use of a circle circuit with pressure-supported or controlled ventilation
	* Provides better control of ventilation
	* Additional:
		* Dead space is minimal
		* Resistance mitigated by use of pressure-support or controlled ventilation
* Paracetamol and local anaesthetic usually adequate for analgesia

###Surgical Stages
Approach may be:
* Open
	* RUQ
	* Periumbilical
* 3x laparascopic ports


##Postoperative
* Risk of respiratory depression  
Monitor for apnoeas for 24/24.
	* GA
	* Metabolic alkalosis
	* Neonate or infant
	* Hypothermia
* [Post-extubation stridor](/anaesthesia/paeds/considerations.md#stridor)


* Mucosal leak
	* Most serious surgical complication
	* May be tested for intraoperatively by instilling gas or saline down the orogastric
