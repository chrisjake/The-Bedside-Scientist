#Laparoscopy

Insufflation of abdominal cavity with CO<sub>2</sub> up to pressures of 20mmHg, in order to facilitate intra-abdominal surgery.

##Physiology
Key changes:
* Respiratory
	* Limited diaphragmatic excursion
		* Elevated airway pressure
		* Decreased pulmonary compliance
		* Atelectasis
	* Increased PaCO<sub>2</sub>  
	Due to absorption of insufflated CO<sub>2</sub>.
* Cardiovascular
	* Decreased preload  
	IVC compression.
	* Increased SVR
		* Inotropes more effective than vasopressors in management of hypotension
	* Decreased splanchnic blood flow  
	Up to 40% reduction in mesenteric blood flow.

##Benefits
Include:
* Reduced incision size
	* Improved post-operative pain
	* Decreased recovery time
	* Decreased post-operative infections


##Risks and Contraindications
Patient:
* Raised ICP  
Due to increased PaCO<sub>2</sub>.
* Severe hypovolaemia
* Right-to-left shunts  
Increased passage with raised venous pressures.


Surgical:
* Organ injury
	* Vascular
	* Bowel
	* Ureteric
	* Venous gas embolism
* Positioning
	* Movement
	* Cerebral oedema/hypoperfusion


Anaesthesia:
* Generally requires ETT  
LMA use controversial.
* Increased PONV
