#Anaesthetic Awareness

Accidental intraoperative awareness is the ability to recall any events which occurred during the period at which it was intended that the patient was unconscious. Awareness:
* Occurs in ~1:20,000 cases  
	* Incidence with NMB is ~1:8200 cases
	* Incidence without NMB is ~1:135,000
	* **Dynamic phase** of anaesthesia is the most common time  
	e.g. Induction and emergence.
* May lead to memory formation  
Memories may be:
	* Explicit  
	Memory of exact events, which may be:
		* Recalled spontaneously
		* Provoked by post-operative events or questioning
	* Implicit  
	Not consciously recalled events, but may affect later behaviour.
* May cause significant psychological harm
	* Insomnia
	* Depression
	* Anxiety
	* PTSD


##Risks
Key factors affecting risk of awareness include:
* **Depth of anaesthesia**  
	* Inspired agent concentration
		* Rare when MAC >0.8
		* Virtually non-existent when MAC >1  
		Once steady state has been reached.
	* Poor anaesthetic technique
		* Omission or late commencement of volatile
		* Underdosing of induction agent
		* Underdosing during hypotensive episodes  
		**Titration of anaesthetic agent to BP increases risk** of awareness.
		* Failure to recognise signs of light anaesthesia
	* Patient factors  
	Increased anaesthetic doses required in:
		* Young age
		* Hyperthyroidism
		* Obesity
		* Anxiety
		* Drug exposures
			* Smokers
			* Heavy alcohol
			* Recreational drug users
			* Repeated anaesthetics
* **Neuromuscular blockade**  
Greatly increases both the incidence and severity of awareness. Particularly:
	* Use of non-depolarising agents
	* Failure to monitor effect of non-depolarising agents
* **High risk surgery**  
	* Cardiac surgery
	* Emergency surgery
	* Significant haemorrhage
	* Caesarian section
* Equipment malfunction


##Clinical Manifestations

>May be masked by β-blockers, anti-muscarinics, among other things

Relate to sympathetic activation:
* ↑ HR
* ↑ BP
* Sweating
* Crying
* Movement/grimacing
* Tachypnoea
* Pupillary dilatation and reactivity

##Management
Includes:
* Preventative
* Intraoperative management
* Post-operative management

###Preventative
* Premedication  
Use of benzodiazepines reduces incidence.
* Use of at least 0.8 MAC of volatile

###Intraoperative Management
* Rapidly deepen anaesthesia
* If hypotension is present, support BP whilst deepening anaesthesia
* Consider administration of IV benzodiazepine  
Will not provide retrograde amnesia, but anterograde amnesia reduces evidence of further recall.

###Post-operative Management
* Obtain and document a detailed account of the experience  
Including:
	* Perioperative timing
	* Distinguish between dreaming and awareness
	* Note details of recalled events  
* Provide support and sympathy  
Denial of veracity of events worsens psychological outcome.
* Offer early support from psychiatric and counselling services


####The Brice Questionnaire
Traditional approach to assessing events:
* Performed twice
	* First at 24-48 hours
	* Second at 7-8 days
* Consists of five questions:
	* What was the last thing you remembered happening before you went to sleep?
	* What is the first thing you remember on waking?
	* Did you dream, or have any other experience whilst you were asleep?
	* What was the worst thing about the operation?"
	* What was the next worst thing?
