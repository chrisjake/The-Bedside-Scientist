#Anaesthetic Strategies


##Spontaneously Ventilating GA
* Propofol/Alfentanil TIVA
	* Use a propofol TCI model (e.g. marsh model)
	* Add alfentanil to propofol syringe
		* Add 1mg to first and second 50ml syringe
		* Add 0.5mg to subsequent syringes  
		Up to ~5-6 syringes worth.
	* Titrate fentanil to respiratory rate



##Remifentanil
Emergence:
* Begin volatile wash out during wound closure
* Trace volatile and remifentanil will keep patients functionally anaesthetised in absence of surgical stimulation
* Remifentanil can be turned off prior to removing patient from the operating table
