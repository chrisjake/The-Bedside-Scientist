#Anaesthetic Strategies

Brief descriptions of anaesthetic strategies for:
* Intubation/induction
* Maintenance
* Emergence


##Intubation/Induction

###Awake Intubation Strategies
Using Propofol & Remifentanil:
* Goal is to keep spontaneous ventilation occurring throughout
* Begin and maintain remifentanil at 0.01μg/kg/min
* Commence propofol TCI at Cp of 1μg/ml
* When the propofol Ce reaches 0.5μg/ml, increase the Cp slowly
* Goal is to have $$Ce - Cp \approx 0.5$$  
This should ensure spontaneous ventilation maintained, though it takes quite some time to achieve.
* Generally:
	* Laryngoscopy is tolerated at Cp of 4μg/ml
	* Intubation is tolerated at Cp of 6μg/ml


###Relaxant-free Intubation
Using Remifentanil:
* 3-5μg/kg, up to ~250μg
* Wait for the bradycardia  
* Beware wooden chest
* Will provide typically 3-4 minutes of apnoea



##Maintenance
###Spontaneously Ventilating GA
Propofol/Alfentanil TIVA:
* Use a propofol TCI model (e.g. marsh model)
* Add alfentanil to propofol syringe
	* Add 1mg to first and second 50ml syringe
	* Add 0.5mg to subsequent syringes  
	Up to ~5-6 syringes worth.
* Titrate additional opioid (oxycodone, fentanyl) to respiratory rate



##Emergence
From volatile and remifentanil
* Begin volatile wash out during wound closure
* Trace volatile and remifentanil will keep patients functionally anaesthetised in absence of surgical stimulation
* Turn off remifentanil prior to transferring patient from the operating table
* Extubate on bed
