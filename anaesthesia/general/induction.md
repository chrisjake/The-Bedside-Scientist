#Induction of Anaesthesia

Induction of anaesthesia generally involves use of:
* Induction agents  
To produce loss of consciousness.
* Muscle relaxants  
To facilitate intubation or surgery.
* Adjuvants  
Classically opioids.


##Induction Agents
Choice and dose of induction agent is individualised. Points to consider:
* Pharmacokinetics
	* Renal failure
	* Hepatic failure
* Pharmacodynamics
	* Titrateability  
	Can anaesthesia be induced slowly (monitoring for effect) or is this an RSI?
	* CVS stability
	* Conscious state  
		* Anxious
		* Obtunded
* Use of adjuvants
* Risks of overdosing
	* CVS depression
	* Respiratory depression
* Risks of underdosing
	* Laryngospasm
	* Awareness


###Comparison of Induction Agents


|Property|Propofol|Ketamine|
|--|--|--|
|**Uses**|- Standard anaesthetic induction|- Induction in patients with CVS compromise
|**Suggested dose**|- 1-2.5mg/kg (reduce in elderly) - <1mg/kg in CVS compromise|- 1-2mg/kg IV or 4-6mg/kg IM(induction)<br>- 0.5-1mg/kg (induction in CVS compromise) 	
|**Advantages**|- Rapid onset (30-45s) and offset <br>- Blunting of laryngeal reflexes<br>- Bronchodilation<br>- Decreases ICP & CBF<br>- Anticonvulsant<br>- Antiemetic|- Rapid onset<br>- Generally improves CVS parameters<br>- Analgesic<br>- Bronchodilatory<br>- Preserves airway reflexes<br>- Generally preserves respiratory drive
|**Disadvantages**|- Hypotension and respiratory depression<br>- Blunting of laryngeal reflexes<br>- Pain on injection<br>- Potential contamination|- Direct myocardial depressant<br>- Psychomimetic effects|


##Muscle Relaxants

##Adjuvants
Commonly used adjuvants include:
* Opioids
* Benzodiazepines
* Lignocaine
