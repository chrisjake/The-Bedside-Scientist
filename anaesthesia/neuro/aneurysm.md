*This covers factors unique to clipping of intracranial aneurysms. Factors relating to craniotomies in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/neuro/craniotomy.md).*


Intracranial aneurysms may be:
* Clipped  
Placing a spring clip across the aneurysmal neck.
	* Temporary clips are typically placed across the proximal vessel prior to clipping to reduce haemorrhage risk
* Coiled  
Endovascularly inserting Guglielmi Detachable Coils to cause the aneurysm is occluded.

##Techniques
Under GA:
* Volatile
* TIVA  
May be preferred in cases with high ICP.

##Considerations
* C
	* **Bleeding from aneurysm is disastrous** and primary concern  

##Preparation
* Standard monitoring
* Awake arterial line
* Large venous access
* CVC


##Induction
* Haemodynamic stability is vital  
Avoid \<10% change in SBP.


##Intraoperative
Aneurysmal rupture:
* Call for help
* Reduce bleeding
	* Induce hypotension to reduce haemorrhage
	* Compress ipsilateral carotid artery to reduce bleeding
* Volume resuscitate
	* Increase IVT rate
	* Begin transfusion
* Consider cerebroprotective strategies


Induced hypotension:  
* May be requested to reduce risk of aneurysmal bleeding  
* Aim SBP 60-80mmHg
Consider:  
	* 5-10mg labetalol boluses
	* Increase anaesthetic depth


Cerebroprotection:
* May be requested if:
	* Clipping a major vessel
	* Aneurysmal rupture
* Thiopentone 3-5mg/kg bolus, then 3-5mg/kg/hr, targeted to burst suppression


##Postoperative
May require ICU care if:
* Complicated intraoperative course
* Vasospasm
* Poor grade SAH prior
