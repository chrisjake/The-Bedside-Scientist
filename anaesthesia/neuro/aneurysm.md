*This covers factors unique to clipping of intracranial aneurysms. Factors relating to craniotomies in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/neuro/craniotomy.md).*


Clipping of an intracranial aneurysm involves placing a spring clip across the aneurysmal neck to occlude it. Clipping is performed under GA. Approaches include:
* TIVA  
May be preferred in cases with high ICP, using propofol and remifentanil.
* Volatile  
Sub-MAC with a remifentanil infusion.


##Considerations
* B
	* **No coughing or movement is tolerated**  
	Dissection of vasculature and aneurysm are delicate.
		* Deep opioid analgesia with remifentanil
		* Deep muscle relaxation (TOF of 0)
* C
	* **Bleeding from aneurysm is disastrous** and primary concern  
	* Consider two IV access sites:  
		* One large volume line
		* One anaesthetic/remifentanil infusion line
* D
	* Cerebroprotective strategies may be required if a temporary clip is placed over a major vessel
* E
	* Muscle relaxation  
	Not *technically* required if using remifentanil, but paralysis recommended given the extreme requirement for immobility.
		* Aim ToF = 0
		* Consider relaxant infusion  
		Cisatracurium reliable and will wear off adequately for extubation.

##Preoperative Assessment


##Preparation
* Standard monitoring
* Awake arterial line
* Large venous access
* Consider CVC  
For aspiration of gas in case of air embolism in patients in seated position.


##Induction
* Haemodynamic stability is vital  
Avoid \<10% change in SBP.


##Intraoperative
Aneurysmal rupture:
* Call for help
* Reduce bleeding
	* Induce hypotension to reduce haemorrhage  
	Many strategies - will depend on anaesthetic currently running/drawn up/what is available. Some include:
		* Propofol  
		Immediately available and intimately familar, but may not be enough.
		* Remifentanil bolus (e.g. 1ug/kg)  
		* Adenosine
		* Esmolol
		* GTN
	* Compress ipsilateral carotid artery to reduce bleeding
* Volume resuscitate
	* Increase IVT rate
	* Begin transfusion
* Consider cerebroprotective strategies


Induced hypotension:  
* May be requested to reduce risk of aneurysmal bleeding  
* Aim SBP 60-80mmHg
Consider:  
	* 5-10mg labetalol boluses
	* Increase anaesthetic depth


Cerebroprotection:
* May be requested if:
	* Clipping a major vessel
	* Aneurysmal rupture
* Thiopentone 3-5mg/kg bolus, then 3-5mg/kg/hr, targeted to burst suppression


###Surgical Stages
* Craniotomy
* Dissection and exposure of aneurysm
Delicate - **ensure immobility**.
* Temporary clipping of vessels supplying aneurysm  
Neuroprotection may be required.
* Clipping of aneurysm  
Multiple clips may be applied.
* Aspiration of aneurysm  
To ensure that there is no further flow to the lesion.

##Postoperative
May require ICU care if:
* Complicated intraoperative course
* Vasospasm
* Poor grade SAH prior
