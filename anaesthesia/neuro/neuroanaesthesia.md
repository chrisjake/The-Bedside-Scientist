#Principles of Neuroanaesthesia

Emphasis in neuroanaesthesia is on:
* Optimal operating conditions
* Maintenance of CPP and cerebral oxygenation

##Anaesthesia Considerations
* D
	* Anaesthetic choice
		* Volatile impairs cerebral autoregulation in:
			* Concentrations >1 MAC
			* Presence of hypercarbia
		* Sevoflurane has the least effect on cerebral blood flow, and is the most suitable volatile agent
		* Propofol reduces ICP and increases CPP to a greater extent than sevoflurane
		* Nitrous oxide has several detrimental effects
	* Rapid emergence improves neurological assessment and early detection of complications
