##Techniques
Under GA:
* Volatile
	* Avoid N<sub>2</sub>O
	* Use < 1 MAC
* TIVA  
May be preferred in cases with high ICP. One approach:
	* TCI propofol at 3-6ug/mL
	* Remifentanil 0.1-0.3ug/kg/min  
	Reduces need for top-up muscle relaxation.

##Considerations
* A
	* Airway is not accessible intraoperatively, intubate and secure well
	* Use a reinforced tube
* B
	* Coughing is not allowed  
	Ensure adequate muscle relaxation (test regularly) or use deep opioid anaesthesia (e.g. remifentanil TIVA).
	* Ventilate to normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> in most instances  
	Avoid cerebral ischaemia.
* C
	* Aim normotension during most procedures  
* E
	* Aim normothermia  
	36°C-37°C.



##Preparation
* Standard monitoring
* Arterial line  
* Core temperature monitoring
* CVC
	* Administration of vasoactives
	* Aspiration of air in case of venous air embolism

##Induction
Haemodynamic stability is important:
* Remifentanil infusion usually adequate
* Otherwise fentanyl (5ug/kg) or alfentanil (25-50ug/kg/hr)

##Intraoperative
Application of clamps:
* Associated with significant hypertension
* Cover with bolus of 0.5-1ug/kg remifentanil or 0.5-1mg/kg propofol

Closure of dura:
* Typically indicates ~30-45 minutes of operating time remaining
* Administer a long-acting opioid when remifentanil infusion is ceased


##Postoperative
* May require additional IV opioid recovery  
Monitor carefully for decreased GCS as this may be either anaesthetic or surgically related.
