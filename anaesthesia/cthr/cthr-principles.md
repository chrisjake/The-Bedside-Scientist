#Principles of Cardiac Anaesthesia

* This covers the general considerations of cardiac anaesthesia except those relating to cardiopulmonary bypass, which are covered here	[here](/anaesthesia/cthr/cpb.md).*

The cardiac anaesthetic needs to prevent decompensation by avoiding:
* **F**ailure  
Minimise:
	* Ischaemia
	* Negative inotropy
	* Swings in preload and afterload
* **A**rrhythmia  
	* Ischaemia
	* Electrolyte abnormalities
* **I**schaemia
	* Maintain CPP  
	Maintain DBP.
	* Minimise MVO<sub>2</sub>.
	* Minimise stress factors
* **L**ow BP  
Especially in left main disease, pulmonary hypertension, and AS.

##Preoperative Evaluation
Evaluation should consider:
* Planned operation
* Age, weight, and height  
For indexing and drug doses.
* Preoperative medications
	* Cease clopidogrel 7-10 days prior
	* Continue beta-blockers, consider initiating
	* Stop ACE-Is
	* Continue statins perioperatively
* Exercise tolerance
* Co-existing disease  
Cardiac patients tend to be sicker. Particularly relevant features:
	* COAD and smoking history  
	Smoking cessation should be encouraged.
	* Hypertension
	* Valvular disease
	* CAD  
	* Cerebrovascular disease
	* Peripheral vascular disease  
	Affects graft sites and arterial line placement.
	* Cognitive function  
	Baseline level of impairment.
	* DM  
	Associated with poorer outcomes.
	* CKD  
	Associated with poorer outcomes.
	* Dysphagia or oesophageal problems
	Affects use of TOE.
* Previous cardiac surgery  
**Re-do sternotomy** is associated with substantial additional risk
	* Pericardium is usually obliterated
	* RV may be adherent to sternum  
	Risk of **massive haemorrhage** due to sternal saw.
	* Internal paddles may not be able to be applied  
	External defib pads should be used.
	* Peripheral bypass (femoral) may need to be established
	* Significantly prolonged case with substantial blood loss 
	Dissection of adhesions and identification of old grafts.


Examination:
* Vital signs
* Airway assessment
* Respiratory and CVS exam
* Peripheral and central vascular access sites


Investigations:
* Bloods
	* FBE
	* UEC/CMP
	* Coagulation profile
	* G+H +/- crossmatch
* General
	* ECG
	* CXR
	* PFTs if indiated by respiratory disease
* Cardiac-specific
	* Angiogram
	* Echocardigram


##Preparation
Lines and monitoring:
* 5-lead ECG
* SpO<sub>2</sub>
* Consider external defibrillation pads
	* Re-do cases
	* Modified aaccess
	* Deactivated AICD
	* Removal of PPM leads
* Arterial line and IVC  
Should be placed awake and on the **right side** if surgeons are not planning on using this vessel.
	* Left sided arteries and vessels lie closer to the sternum
	* Damage to left innominate vein will render any left upper limb venous access useless
* Consider awake central access  
MAC lines are excellent choice for volume as well as providing a route of administration of centrally acting drugs.
* Pulmonary artery catheter  
Indicated in the setting of:
	* Severe LV dysfunction (EF<30%)
	* MV dysfunction
	* AKI


Drugs (Push):
* 2% lignocaine in 3ml syringe with 25G needle for vascular access
* Midazolam 5mg in 5ml
* Fentanyl 500ug-1mg in 10 or 20ml syringe
* Propofol 200mg in 20ml
* Cephazolin 2g
* Metaraminol 10mg in 20ml
* Rocuronium 100mg in 2x5ml


* Heparin 300 units/kg if heparin naive


Drugs (Infusions):
* TXA 5g in 50ml
* Propofol 500mg in 50ml
* +/- Noradrenaline 3mg in 50ml
* +- GTN 6mg in 50ml


##Anaesthetic
Induction:
* Aim is a haemodynamically stable induction  
Typically large dose of fentanyl, some benzodiazepine, and a small dose of propofol. Aim is:
	* No myocardial depression
	* No autonomic response
	* No change in SVT
* Antibiotics prior to skin incision

Position:
* Head ring
* Leg padding
* Place head frame
* Arms positioned  
Tucked if not used for grafts.
