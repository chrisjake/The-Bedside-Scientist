#Cardiopulmonary Bypass

Use of an external pump and oxygenator to generate pulseless blood flow and facilitate gas exchange. CPB involves:
* Cannulation may be central or peripheral
	* Central  
	Right atrium access and aortic return.
	* Peripheral  
	Typically femoral-femoral.
* Pump
	* Roller-head
	* Centrifugal  
	Less trauma to blood.
* Cardioplegic solution  
Hyperkalaemic solutions to induce asystole; reducing oxygen consumption and myocardial metabolic rate.
* Cooling  
Typically cooled to < 34째C to reduce oxygen consumption.
* Anticoagulation  
Systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent clotting of the bypass circuit.
	* Use of a pump requires at least partial anticoagulation  
	ACT > 180.
	* Use of an oxygenator requires full heparinisation  
	ACT > 400.


##Technique
###Prior to CPB
Anaesthetist:
* Ensure both a central and peripheral temperature monitor are in situ if deep hypothermic arrest is going to be performed
* Prior to sternotomy, ensure:
	* Blood pressure is well controlled  
	Reduces the chance of significant haemorrhage from vascular damage.
	* Cease ventilation prior to sternotomy
* Measure baseline ACT  
Normal is 90-130.
* Commence TXA infusion  
	* Some evidence demonstrating reduced fibrinolysis, blood loss, ICC output, reoperation, and transfusion requirement
	* Many different protocols with wide variability in dosing  
	One protocol: 1g bolus then 6.5mg/kg/hr.
* Complete pre-bypass checklist:
**HAD2SAVE**:
	* Heparin given  
	Confirm administration by verifying back-bleeding from heparin delivery line.
	* ACT >480  
	Threshold varies between centres.
		* Take sample from arterial line, or failing that PA distal on a PAC
	* Drugs  
		* Consider additional analgesia, relaxant prior to going on CPB.
		* Vaporiser off
	* Drips off
	* Swan
		* Drugs not being infused down RV port during CPB  
		Will not be given during bypass, resulting in a bolus of these drugs into the systemic circulation when coming off CPB.
	* Alarms  
	Disable alarms.
	* Ventilator
		* Swap onto bag and open APL valve
		* Disable alarms
	* Ensure anaesthesia continues  
	Anaesthetic plan with perfusionist for either TIVA or volatile.


Perfusionist:
* Prime circuit with bypass solution  
Combination of heparinised crystalloid and colloid.


###Instituting CPB
Anaesthetist:
* Prepare 300 Units/kg heparin
	* Give heparin when requested  
	**Close loop**.
	* Chect ACT **3 minutes** post UFH
	Confirm ACT >400 prior to cannulation.
* Reduce SBP to 80-100mmHg to reduce risk of aortic dissection during cannulation
	* Too low and there is increased risk of puncturing the posterior wall of the aorta, leading to dissection
	* Too high and there is increased risk of aortic dissection from the anterior wall
* Connects coronary sinus cannula to PA transducer and monitors pressure
* Confirm coronary sinus cannula is correctly sited  
Used for retrograde cardioplegia.
* Monitor for LV distension with TOE  
May occur with anterograde cardioplegia if there is aortic regurgitation.


Surgeon:
* Places pericardial stay sutures  
May impair atrial filling and cause hypotension.
* Places aortic purse-string sutures
* Places atrial purse-string sutures  
May cause atrial arrythmia. If unstable:
	* Temporise with vasopressor and volume, then go onto bypass
	* Synchronised DCR  
	Clutters surgical field.
* Places aortic return cannula
* Places atrial access cannula  
	* At this point, bypass may commence although the heart is still beating
	* Access cannula may be
		* Bicaval  
		Two separate cannulas, one to the IVC and one to the SVC.
		* Single, larger dual-stage cannula
* Places retrograde cardioplegia cannula
* Places anterograde cardioplegia catheter
	* An LV vent (typically through the right upper pulmonary vein) may be placed if the anterograde cardioplegia causes LV distension
* Monitors heart as CPB initiated
* Cross-clamps aorta once on bypass

Perfusionist:
* Gradually releases clamp on venous line, increasing bypass flow and reducing right heart CO
* Left heart empties due to reduced right sided CO  
Signifcant left sided CO at this stage implies a problem:
	* Obstruction of venous bypass line
	* Significant AR
	* PDA
* Deliver cardioplegia once aorta is cross clamped
Typically contain high potassium and magnesium concentrations.
	* Produce asystole when rapidly infused
	* Cold cardioplegia is cardioprotective for ischaemia
	* Cardioplegia may be delivered:
		* Retrograde via the coronary sinus  
		Typically retrograde will preserve LV function better than anterograde, especially when there is AR or severe CAD. The same benefit is not seen in RV function, as the RV is drained via the anterior cardiac veins.
		* Anterograde via the coronary arteries




###During CPB
Anaesthetist:
* Cease ventilation


Perfusionist:
* Deliver nonpulsatile flow of ~2.4L/min/m<sup>2</sup> to approximate a normal CI
* Aim MAP 50-70mmHg
* Continue anaesthesia
	* Via TIVA
	* Via volatile agent  
	Can be vapourised into bypass circuit.
* Cool to 28-34째C  
Cooler temperatures provide better cerebral protection but require longer times for rewarming.
* Monitor blood gases and ACT  
Typically every 30 minutes, aiming:
	* Normal gas exchange
	* Hb > 60
	* BE < 2.5
	* ACT >400
* Continues to deliver cardioplegia as required
	* Typically every 10-15 minutes or at surgeon request
	* May deliver a 'hot shot'  
	Warmed cardioplegic blood given as the last bolus prior to rewarming.
		* Decreases chance of immediate post-operative arrhythmia
* Rewarms patient prior to weaning  
Ensure that central-peripheral temperature gradient is <2째C as this increases the risk of neurological complications.
	* Slow down rate of rewarming if this occurs


###Prior to Weaning
Complete a pre-wean checklist and confirm:
* A:
	* ETT is in situ
* B:
	* Hand ventilate both lungs and visually check for inflation  
	Re-establish FRC with a high FiO<sub>2</sub> to reduce immediate shunt.
	* Appropriate blood gases on bypass circuit
* C:
	* De-airing  
	Assess for residual air in cardiac chambers.
	* Estimate what the patients cardiac state will likely be during wean and aim to optimise each facet:
		* Rate and Rhythm  
		Pacing wires in situ and pacing is set. A suggested approach:
			* AOO/AAI or DOO/DDD
			* High amplitudes (e.g. 16mA)
			* High sensing threshold if using a synchronus mode
			Decreases chance of diathermy interference.
		* Preload  
		* Afterload  
		Start vasopressors or dilators that may be required.
		* Contractility  
		Start inotropes that may be required.
* D:
	* Confirm BSL 6-10 mmol/L
	* Method for delivery anaesthesia is present
* E:
	* Temperature ~36째C
* F:
	* pH is 7.35-7.45
	* Potassium 4.5-5mmol/L
* H:
	* Hct > 0.2


###Weaning from CPB
Anaesthetist:
* Monitor cardiac function as heart is slowly refilled  
Adjust infusions if necessary. Ensure good flow rates of carrier fluid to enable rapid titration and reduce the effect of dead space.
	* Look for rapid rate of rise of the arterial line waveform
	* Look at ventricular performance on TOE  
	Global EF and wall function.
	* Start inotropes if required
	* An IABP may be required if LV function is very poor
* Defibrillate if required  
Arrhythmias are common.
	* 10-20J, announce when charged
	* Defibrillate when surgeon instructs
	* May need multiple shocks if persistent VT/VF
	* Pharmacotherapy may be required:
		* IV amiodarone
		* Magnesium
		* Esmolol
* Check pacing  
Generally pace 88-90 to improve CO during weaning period.
* Aim SBP <100mmHg during aortic decannulation


* Reverse heparinisation **when fully off bypass**  
Give 1mg protamine per 100 units of UFH.
	* Don't draw up protamine (or hide it somewhere) until reversal is required
	* Monitor for systemic hypotension/pulmonary hypertension, high airway pressures, circulatory arrest  
	May need to crash back onto bypass.
	* Give test dose of 1-2ml initially
	* Given *slowly*, typically 2-3ml/min
* Check ACT 3 minutes after protamine has finished

Perfusionist:
* Progressive clamping of the venous line  
Allows the heart to fill and eject.


Surgeon:
* Remove venous access cannula
* Remove cardioplegia lines
* Remove aortic cannula


####Difficulty Weaning from Bypass
Check and optimise:
* Preload
	* Check EDV on TOE and filling pressures (CVP, PADP)
	* Give volume
* Contractility
	* Check systolic function on TOE, CI on PAC, and visual assessment over draps
	* Give inotropes, consider IABP
* Afterload
	* Give vasopressors
* Rate  
Pace if <88.
* Rhythm  
Evaluate for arrythmia.
* Anaesthetic factors
	* Electrolytes
	* Temperature
	* Gas exchange
* Surgical factors
	* Absence of major surgical problem
	* Absence of dynamic obstruction
	* Major bleeding controlled
	* Chambers de-aired


###After Weaning from CPB
Anaesthetist:
* Aim SBP 80-140mmHg
* Maintain high-normal potassium
* Check ABG, ACT, and TEG post reversal

##Complications
Use of bypass is associated with several complications including:
* A
	* Air emboli
		* CVA
		* CAGE
* C
	* Myocardial stunning  
	EF is reduced immediately post-bypass.
	* Dysrhythmias
	* Impaired organ perfusion, leading to post-bypass:
		* AKI	
		* Post-pump vasoplegia
* D
	* Increased risk of anaesthetic awareness
* H
	* Coagulopathy
