#Cardiopulmonary Bypass

Use of an external pump and oxygenator to generate pulseless blood flow and facilitate gas exchange. CPB involves:
* Cannulation may be central or peripheral
	* Central  
	Right atrium access and aortic return.
	* Peripheral  
	Typically femoral-femoral.
* Cardioplegic solution  
Hyperkalaemic solutions to induce asystole; reducing oxygen consumption and myocardial metabolic rate.
* Cooling  
Typically cooled to < 34°C to reduce oxygen consumption.
* Anticoagulation  
Systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent clotting of the bypass circuit.


##Technique
###Prior to CPB
The patient:
* Reduce SBP to 80-100mmHg to reduce risk of aortic dissection during cannulation
* Measure baseline coagulation factors
	* ABG
	* ACT
	* TEG/ROTEM
* Fully anticoagulate  
	* Typically 300U/kg of heparin
	* Confirm ACT >400 prior to cannulation

The bypass circuit:
* Primed with crystalloid solution
* Delivers nonpulsatile flow of ~2.4L/min/m<sup>2</sup> to approximate a normal CI


###Going on Bypass
The patient:
* Deliver cardioplegia  
Typically contain high potassium and magnesium concentrations.
	* Produce asystole when rapidly infused
	* Cold cardioplegia is cardioprotective for ischaemia
	* Cardioplegia may be delivered:
		* Retrograde via the coronary sinus
		* Anterograde via the coronary arteries


###During CPB
The patient:
* Cease ventilation
* Aim MAP 50-70mmHg
* Continue anaesthesia
	* Via TIVA
	* Via volatile agent  
	Can be vapourised into bypass circuit.
* Cool to 28-34°C  
Cooler temperatures provide better cerebral protection but require longer times for rewarming.
* Monitor blood gases and ACT  
Typically every 30 minutes.


###Prior to Weaning
Confirm:
* Hct > 0.2
* Temperature ~37°C
* pH is 7.35-7.45
* Potassium 4.5-5mmol/L
 

###Weaning from CPB
Involves:
* Progressive clamping of the venous line  
Allows the heart to fill and eject.
* Monitor cardiac systolic function  
Commence inotropes if contractility is poor.


* Reverse heparinisation  
Give 1mg protamine per 100 units of UFH.
	* Don't draw up protamine until reversal is required
	* Monitor for systemic hypotension/pulmonary hypertension


* Aim SBP 80-140mmHg
* Maintain high-normal potassium
* Check ABG, ACT, and TEG post reversal

##Complications
Use of bypass is associated with several complications including:
* Myocardial stunning  
EF is reduced immediately post-bypass.
* CVA
	* Air embolus
* Impaired organ perfusion, leading to post-bypass:
	* AKI
	* Vasoplegia
