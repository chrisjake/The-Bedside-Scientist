#Mitral Valve Replacement
>Airway: ETT <br>
>Access: 14G IVC or MAC line, arterial line, CVC, +/- PAC <br>
>Pain: Substantial, especially in younger patients<br>
>Position: Supine/crucifix <br>
>Time: 3-4 hours  <br>
>Blood loss: ~400ml. G+H required, consider cross-match of at least 2 units.<br>
> Special: CPB - higher risk for anaesthetic awareness. Risk of air embolism as left heart is opened.

Repair or replacement of the mitral valve for:
* Mitral Stenosis
* Mitral regurgitation
* Endocarditis

Mitral valve repair is performed for:
* Posterior leaflet abnormalities
* Annula dilation

##Considerations
* B
	* Pulmonary oedema  
	May have secondary effusions.
* C
	* Atrial fibrillation
		* Often coexistent due to atrial dilation  
		May be anticoagulated.
		* AF may result in precipitous decline in both MS and MR
	* Severity of valvular disease
	* Presence of coronary disease
	* Pulmonary artery hypertension  
	May be associated with both MR and MS.
	* Defend perfusion pressure
		* MS leads to a relatively fixed CO and elevated SVR; therefore CBF will fall and not be compensated with a fall in perfusion pressure
	* Avoid elevation in PVR

##Preoperative Assessment
Evaluation should consider:
* Severity of valvular disease
* Consequences of valvular disease
	* PHTN
	* Cardiac remodelling
* Presence of coexisting coronary disease

##Preparation
*This covers factors unique to MVR. Factors relating to cardiac surgery in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cthr/cthr-principles.md#id).*

##Induction
##Intraoperative
###Surgical Stages
For standard approach:
* Sternotomy
* Establish CPB
* Empty left heart via the PA
* Establish diastolic arrest
* Left atrium is opened
* Decision made for repair or replacement, and this is performed
* LV and atrium are filled
* Atrium is closed
* Ventricle is de-aired
* Cross-clamp is removed and coronary perfusion commences
* Wean from CPB occurs once air is removed from circulation

##Postoperative
