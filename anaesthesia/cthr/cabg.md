#Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
>Airway: ETT
>Access: 14G IVC or MAC line, arterial line, CVC, +/- PAC
>Pain: 
>Position: Supine/crucifix
>Time: 3-4 hours
>Blood loss: Cross-match 2 units
>Special: CPB - higher risk for anaesthetic awareness

Use of an autologous artery or vein to bypass a stenosed section of coronary artery and restore downstream perfusion.

##Preoperative Evaluation
Evaluation should consider:
* Co-existing disease
	* COAD and smoking
	* Hypertension
	* Valvular disease
	* CAD  
	Including previous MI and PCI.
	* Cerebrovascular disease
	* DM
	* CKD
* Cardiac function
	* Exercise tolerance
	* Echocardiographic findings
	* Coronary angiogram
	* Exercise ECG
* Previous cardiac surgery  
**Re-do sternotomy** is associated with risk of **massive haemorrhage**. At least 2 units of **blood should be available**.

##Technique: Relaxant GA
Almost always performed under relaxant general anaesthesia.

###Preparation
* 5-lead ECG
* Temperature monitor
* Pulmonary artery catheter
	* Severe LV dysfunction (EF<30%)
	* MV dysfunction
	* AKI
* Awake arterial line placement
* Consider awake central access

###Induction
* Antibiotics prior to skin incision
* Haemodynamically stable induction

###Intraoperative
* Cease ventilation prior to sternotomy

###Postoperative Care
* Transfer intubated to PACU/ICU

##Special Considerations
Complications can include:
* Massive haemorrhage
* Severe LV or RV dysfunction
	* Pulmonary oedema
	* May be unable to wean from bypass
* Atelectasis
* Bronchospasm
