#Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting

>Airway: ETT <br>
>Access: 14G IVC or MAC line, arterial line, CVC, +/- PAC <br>
>Pain: Substantial, especially in younger patients<br>
>Position: Supine/crucifix <br>
>Time: 3-4 hours  <br>
>Blood loss: G+H required. Cross-match if **re-do surgery**, anaemic, small, sick, or emergency. <br>
>Special: CPB - higher risk for anaesthetic awareness  

Use of an autologous artery or vein to bypass a stenosed section of coronary artery and restore downstream perfusion. CABGs:
* Are almost always performed under relaxant general anaesthesia.
* Can be performed 'on-pump' (with CPB) or 'off-pump'

##Considerations
* B
	* Atelectasis
	* Bronchospasm
* C
	* Severe LV or RV dysfunction
		* Pulmonary oedema
		* May be unable to wean from bypass
* H
	* Massive haemorrhage


##Preoperative Assessment
*This covers factors unique to CABG. Factors relating to cardiac surgery in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cthr/cthr-principles.md#id).*

Evaluation should consider:
* CAD  
High risk features:
	* History:
		* Unstable angina
		* AMI within last 3 months
		* Cardiogenic shock
		* Decompensated CCF
	* Coronary anatomy:
		* **Left main disease**  
		Avoid drop in perfusion pressure in the case of critical left main stenosis.
		* Triple vessel disease
		* Proximal LAD stenosis
	* Ventricular function:
		* LVEF < 30%
		* Concominant RV dysfunction

##Preparation
As for [other cardiac surgery](/anaesthesia/cthr/cthr-principles.md#prep).

##Induction
* Aim for haemodynamic stability, especially in the setting of critical left main stenosis

###Intraoperative
*This covers factors unique to CABG. Factors relating to bypass are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cthr/cpb.md#id).*

On-pump CABG can be divided into pre-, intra-, and post-bypass phases:
* Pre-bypass
	* If LIMA harvest is occurring:
		* Decrease V<sub>T</sub> to 5-6ml/kg
		* Reduce anaesthetic  
		Period of minimal stimulation following the very stimulating sternotomy.
		* Increase FiO<sub>2</sub> as there is a frequent surgical requirement for apnoea
* Bypass
* Post-bypass


###Surgical Stages

###Postoperative Care
* Transfer intubated to PACU/ICU
