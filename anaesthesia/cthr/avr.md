#Aortic Valve Replacement
>Airway: ETT <br>
>Access: 14G IVC or MAC line, arterial line, CVC, +/- PAC <br>
>Pain: Substantial, especially in younger patients<br>
>Position: Supine/crucifix <br>
>Time: 3-4 hours  <br>
>Blood loss: G+H required. Cross-match if **re-do surgery**, anaemic, small, sick, or emergency. <br>
>Special: CPB - higher risk for anaesthetic awareness  

Replacement of the aortic valve is performed vfor:
* Stenosis
* Regurgitation
* Stenosis/Regurgitation
* Endocarditis

Surgery:
* Typically involves valve replacement  
	* Repair is rarely achievable
	* May be performed with:
		* Bioprosthetic valves
			* Porcine or bovine
			* Do not require anticoagulation
			* Do not last as long as mechanical valves
		* Mechanical valves
			* Require anticoagulation
			* Last longer than bioprosthetic valves
		* Homografts  
		Rarely available.

##Considerations
*This covers factors unique to AVR. Factors relating to cardiac surgery in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cthr/cthr-principles.md#id).*

* B
	* Left heart failure
* C
	* LVH  
		* Often occurs secondary to AS
		* Increases importance of good myocardial protection on CPB



##Preparation
*This covers factors unique to AVR. Factors relating to cardiac surgery in general are covered [here](/anaesthesia/cthr/cthr-principles.md#id).*

##Induction
* Haemodynamically stable induction is vital
	* Consider vasopressor infusion in critical AS.
	* Filling is important in AS and beneficial in AR

##Intraoperative
###Surgical Stages
* Median sternotomy
* Bicaval and aortic cannulation
* Establishement of CPB
* LV drained via PA
* Cardioplegia administered
* Aorta opened and existing valve excised and annulus debrided
* Annulus measured and valvular prostehesis sutured in place  
Rewarming during final stages of valvular implantation.
* Filing of the LV during aortic closure
* Left heart de-aired in the **head down** position
* Decannulation and reversal of heparinisation

##Postoperative
