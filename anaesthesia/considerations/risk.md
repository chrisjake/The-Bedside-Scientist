#Risk and Consent

Discussion of risk is a precursor to gaining informed consent from a patient, and therefore is a moral and legal requirement. *How* this discussion takes place, and how much information to be given depends on:
* Clinical acuity
* Relative urgency
* Relative risk of performing vs. not performing an intervention
* The individual patient and their perception of material risk


##Approach
Use **BRAN**:
* Benefits
* Risks
* Alternatives
* Nothing  
What will happen if we do nothing.
