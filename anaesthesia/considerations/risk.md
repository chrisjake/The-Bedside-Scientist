#Risk and Consent

Discussion of risk is a precursor to gaining informed consent from a patient, and therefore is a moral and legal requirement. *How* this discussion takes place, and how much information to be given depends on:
* Clinical acuity
* Relative urgency
* Relative risk of performing vs. not performing an intervention
* The individual patient and their perception of material risk


##Consent
Elements:
* Capacity
	* Comprehend general information about procedure  
	Can be quite brief/broad overview.
	* Retain and weigh up information  
	Often the critical point. Relevant in minors for **Gillick competence**, where a minor can consent to certain procedures provided they can understand and weigh up risks.
	* Communicate decision
* Information
	* Prognosis
	* Treatment
	* Options
	* Risks
* Voluntary  
Without:	
	* Coercion
	* Fraud

Refusal:
* Patients can refuse for any reason at all, rational or irrational, provided they have capacity and have been provided adequate information


###Approach
Use **BRAN**:
* Benefits
* Risks
* Alternatives
* Nothing  
What will happen if we do nothing.


##Negligence
Negligence requires:
* A duty of care exists  
Basically assumed in medical cases.
* Duty of care has to be breached
* Harm has to be suffered
* Harm would not have occurred if breach did not occur
