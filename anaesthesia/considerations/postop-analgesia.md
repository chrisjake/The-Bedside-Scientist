#Post-Operative Analgesia



##Neuraxial Techniques

###Epidural
* Can be used as a sole technique  
E.g. epidural top-up for LUSCS.
* Can be used as an adjunct to general anaesthesia
	* May be used for either thoracic or abdominal operations
	* Epidural should be sited depending on surgical site
		* Middle of the surgical incision for low-thoracic epidurals
		* Relatively more cranially (i.e. top half) of the incision for high-thoracic epidurals  
		Higher sites of insertion exhibit less cranial spread of epidurally administered LA.
* Use of high concentration (e.g. 0.75% bupivacaine) leads to a rapid onset of sensory and motor blockade  
Motor blockade provides muscle relaxation, decreasing the requirement to administer NMBD.
	* 3-5ml of 0.75% bupivacaine can be used for top-up
* Provides ~ 1/10 reduction in pain over the first 24 hours postoperatively
* May have additional benefits:
	* Improved cardiac function  
	Afterload and preload reduction, coronary dilation.
	* Reduces muscle catabolism and subsequent hyperglycaemia
	* Decreases duration of postoperative ileus  
* Complications
	* Those relating to insertion and management of any epidural
	* Hypotension
		* May require HDU monitoring/vasopressors
		* Better corrected with vasopressors than volume  
		Vasopressors demonstrated to more likely improve GI blood flow than excessive fluid.

###Intrathecal Opioid
>* Lowest possible dose (usually 100-150µg) should be used
>* Respiratory monitoring should occur for at least 18-24 hours following a single dose

* Morphine is the most commonly studied drug
* Typically 100-500µg used  
	* Generally higher doses used in cardiac or thoracic surgery
	* No benefit seen in exceeding 300µg
	* No strong-dose response relationship demonstrated in meta-analyses
* Quality of analgesia:
	* Similar to epidural for liver resection
	* Duration of ~18-24 hours
		* Reduction in morphine use may extend up to 48 hours
	* Prolongs duration of intrathecal anaesthesia
	* High degree of patient satisfaction, despite side effects
* Complications include:
	* Nausea/Vomiting
	* Pruritus  
	10-15%.
		* Amenable to subcutaneous naloxone
	* Urinary retention
	* Respiratory depression  
		* May be:
			* Hypoxic or hypercapnoeic with an normal respiratory rate
			* Decreased respiratory rate with normal gases
			* **Pupil size** does not correlate with degree of respiratory depression
		* Typically biphasic  
		Second peak is delayed, occurring at 8-12 hours.
		* NNH 15-84
