#Peri-Operative Management of Anticoagulation and Antiplatelets

Effective management of anticoagulation requires balancing thrombo-embolic and haemorrhagic risk. In general:
* Bridging therapy should be used in those at high risk of stroke  
Defined as >10% annualised risk of stroke.
* DAPT is required:
	* For 4 weeks for BMS
	* Up to 12 months for DES 
	Complex stenting may require increased duration.

##Risk Stratification
Patients can be divided by:
* Thrombotic risk
* Bleeding (surgical) Risk

Patients can then be stratified into:
* **Low thromboembolic** and **low bleeding risk**  
Continue anticoagulation.
* **Low thromboembolic** and **high bleeding risk**  
Withhold anticoagulation and antiplatlet agents (see below) without bridging.
* **High thromboembolic** and **high bleeding risk**  
Withhold anticoagulation and antiplatlet agents, and consider **bridging therapy**.


###Thrombotic Risk
Divided into:
* **High risk**  
>10% annual CVA risk. Includes:
	* AF with:
		* Valvular AF  
		AF secondary to valvular disease (either prosthetic, or related to rheumatic valvular disease) has a much higher stroke rate than non-valvular AF.
		* CHADS<sub>2</sub> 5-6 in non-valvular AF
		* CVA/TIA in last 3 months
	* Mechanical valves:
		* Any mechanical mitral valve
		* Old mechanical aortic valve  
		Ball and cage, tilting disc.
	* VTE where:
		* VTE in last 3 months  
		If VTE occured in last month AND anticoagulation is contraindicated, consider an IVC filter.
		* Severe thrombophilia
		* Protein C/S or antithrombin deficiency
* **Intermediate risk**  
4-10% annual CVA risk. Includes:
	* AF with CHADS<sub>2</sub> 3-4
	* Bileaflet mechanical aortic valve with any CVA risk factor
	* VTE where:
		* VTE in the last 3-12 months
		* Recurrent VTE
		* Active malignancy
* **Low risk**  
< 4% annual risk. Includes:
	* CHADS<sub>2</sub> 0-2
	* Bileaflet mechanical aortic valve alone
	* VTE >12 months ago


###Bleeding Risk
Surgical risk of bleeding is classified into:
* Low risk
	* Can be performed with an INR of 1.5-1.8
	* Includes:
		* Dental surgery
			* Extraction of 1-3 teeth
			* Periodontal surgery
			* Abscess incision and draining
		* Opthalmological surgery
			* Cataract surgery
			* Glaucoma intervention
		* Endoscopy without surgery (but with biopsy)
		* Superficial surgery  
		e.g. Excision of skin lesions.
		* PPM/ICD insertion in absence of complex anatomy
		* EP study or simple ablations
		* Trans-radial endovascular/angiographic procedures
* High risk
	* Bleeding risk is not elevated with an INR of â‰¤1.5
	* Bleeding risk is elevated with INR >2.0


##Management of Antiplatelets
|Drug|When to cease|
|--|--|
|**Aspirin**|Usually continued, as risk of bleeding not substantially increased but risk of perioperative CVS event is increased 3-fold.<br>Cease 5-7 days prior to surgery if required.
|**Clopidogrel**|5-7 days|
|**Prasugrel**|5-7 days|
|**Ticagreol**|5-7 days|

Discussion with cardiology team required if DAPT interrupted inside of PCI window.

##Management of Oral Anticoagulants

|Drug|When to cease for **low bleeding risk surgery**|When to cease for **high bleeding risk surgery**|
|--|--|
|**Warfarin**|5 days; check INR (see below)|5 days; check INR|
|**Dabigatran**|24 hours (normal renal function)<br>48-72 hours (eGFR < 50mL/min)|48-72 hours (normal renal function)<br>96 hours (eGFR < 50mL/min)|
|**Rivaroxaban**|24 hours (normal renal function)<br>48 hours (eGFR < 50mL/min)|48-72 hours (normal renal function)<br> 72 hours (eGFR < 50mL/min)|
|**Apixaban**|24 hours (normal renal function)<br>48 hours (eGFR < 50mL/min)|48-72 hours (normal renal function)<br> 72 hours (eGFR < 50mL/min)|

Discuss with haematology if eGFR is < 30mL/min.

###Management of Warfarin
For **low risk of thromboembolism**:
* Check **INR day prior to surgery**
	* If INR 2-3; administer 3mg IV vitamin K
* Check **INR day of surgery**
	* If INR < 1.5  
	Surgery can proceed.
	* If INR > 1.5:
		* Defer surgery, or
		* Reverse warfarin with
			* Prothrombin factor concentrate (preferable)
			* FFP
			10-15ml/kg.
* Warfarin can recommence night after surgery at the previous maintenance dose
* Thromboprophylaxis can be used until warfarin is therapeutic


For **high risk of thromboembolism**, two options exist:
* **Bridging**  
Uses a short-acting anticoagulant (typically UFH or LMWH) to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation whilst longer acting drugs are withdrawn. Perform by:
	* Withhold warfarin 4-5 days prior to surgery
	* Monitor INR
	* When INR < 2.0  
	Commence anticoagulation with:
		* LMWH  
		1.5mg/kg daily or 1mg/kg BD.
		* UFH infusion  
		Cease 4-6 hours prior to surgery.
* **Late reversal**  
Appropriate when INR is stable in the preceeding 2-4 weeks.
	* Cease warfarin day prior to surgery
	* Administer 3mg IV vitamin K
	* Check INR day of surgery:
		* INR < 1.5  
		Surgery can proceed.
		* INR > 1.5  
			* Delay surgery
			* Reverse residual warfarin effect with prothrombinex or FFP


###Management of Novel Oral Anticoagulants
Note that NOACs:
* Generally do not require bridging due to the shorter half-life
* Can be restarted:
	* 6-8 hours post-operatively in the case of low bleeding risk and complete haemostasis achieved  
	* 48-72 hours post-operatively in the case of high bleeding risk  
	Can cconsider reduced dose on evening and first-postoperative day if bleeding and thrombosis risk are high.
* For emergency surgery:
	* Cease NOAC
	* Deferring 12-24 hours since the last dose is ideal  
	If not possible, discuss with surgeons, haematologist, and cardiology to plan management of bleeding.
	* Coagulation assays **do not give a *quant*itative measurement** of anticoagulation status, but **can be used *qual*itatively**  
	Surgery can proceed if:
		* Dabigatran  
		Normal APTT and TT, or normal APTT and mildly prolonged TT.
		* Rivaroxaban  
		Normal PT.
		* Apixaban  
		Normal Anti-Xa.
