#Fasting {#id}

Fasting:
* Aims to decrease the risk of perioperative regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents  
May lead to:
	* Chemical pneumonitis
	* Bacterial pneumonia
	* Airway obstruction
* Should be of duration to minimise aspiration
* May be **detrimental when prolonged**
Fasting >6 hours may:
	* Prevent optimal gastric emptying
	* Lead to deleterious metabolic effects
	* Annoy patients


##Fasting for Adults
For elective surgery:
* **Solid** food up to **6 hours prior**
* **Clear fluid** of **200ml per hour up to 2 hours prior**  
Clear fluids are defined as:
	* Water
	* Pulp-free juice
	* Clear cordial
	* Black tea  
	Note milk is excluded.
	* Black coffee
* **Medications** may be taken up to **2 hours prior** with water
* Chewing gum should be discarded  
Due to risk of aspiration/foreign body rather than due to increasing gastric contents.

###Exceptions
These guidelines may not apply. Important considerations:
* High-risk patients
	* Delayed gastric emptying
	* Previous bariatric surgery  
		* Lap bands
		* Gastric bypass
	* Previous oesophagectomy
	* Oesophageal dysmotility
	* Pregnancy
* Use of risk-reduction techniques
	* Pharmacological
		* PPI
		* H<sub>2</sub>-antagonists
		* Antacids
			* Sodium citrate
			* Aluminium hydroxide
	* Rapid-Sequence Induction

##Fasting for Children
