#Operative Analgesia



##Neuraxial Techniques

###Epidural
* Can be used as a sole technique  
E.g. epidural top-up for LUSCS.
* Can be used as an adjunct to general anaesthesia
	* May be used for either thoracic or abdominal operations
	* Epidural should be sited depending on surgical site
		* Middle of the surgical incision for low-thoracic epidurals
		* Relatively more cranially (i.e. top half) of the incision for high-thoracic epidurals  
		Higher sites of insertion exhibit less cranial spread of epidurally administered LA.
* Use of high concentration (e.g. 0.75% bupivacaine) leads to a rapid onset of sensory and motor blockade  
Motor blockade provides muscle relaxation, decreasing the requirement to administer NMBD.
	* 3-5ml of 0.75% bupivacaine can be used for top-up
* Provides ~ 1/10 reduction in pain over the first 24 hours postoperatively
* May have additional benefits:
	* Improved cardiac function  
	Afterload and preload reduction, coronary dilation.
	* Reduces muscle catabolism and subsequent hyperglycaemia
	* Decreases duration of postoperative ileus  
* Complications
	* Those relating to insertion and management of any epidural
	* Hypotension
		* May require HDU monitoring/vasopressors
		* Better corrected with vasopressors than volume  
		Vasopressors demonstrated to more likely improve GI blood flow than excessive fluid.

###Intrathecal Morphine
* Can be used with or without LA
* Typically 100-500 µg used  
	* Generally higher doses used in cardiac or thoracic surgery
* No strong-dose response relationship demonstrated in meta-analyses
* Provides ~ 1/10 reduction in pain over the first 24 hours postoperatively
* Complications include:
	* Nausea/Vomiting
	* Pruritis
	* Respiratory depression  
		* Typically biphasic  
		Second peak is delayed, occurring at 8-12 hours.
		* NNH 15-84
