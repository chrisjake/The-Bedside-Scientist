#Principles of Thoracic Anaesthesia

*This covers general considerations for thoracic anaesthesia, with the exception of [one-lung ventilation](/management/resp/olv.md).*

Key considerations:
* Pre-operative optimisation
	* Smoking cessation
	* Exercise
		* Secretion clearance
	* Optimise lungs
		* Bronchodilators
		* Steroids
		* Antibiotics
	* Secretions
		* Chest physiotherapy
		* Spirometry
* Indication
	* Tumour
		* Mass effect  
		Mediastinal mass.
		* Metabolic
		* Metastases
		* Medication
	* Bullectomy
	* LVRS
	* Transplant
* Respiratory Assessment  
* Ventilator Weaning  
Dependent on PPO FEV<sub>1</sub>:
	* ⩾40%  
	Extubate in operating room.
	* 30-40%  
	Consider extubation.
	* ⩽30%  
		* Staged weaning
		* Consider thoracic epidural



##Respiratory assessment{#lung}
Prediction of post-operative pulmonary function is vital to:
* Confirm suitability  
Stratify to:
	* Curative-intent
	* Defined limits of resection



Each is looked at in order; a pass in any section indicates suitability for resection:
* [Respiratory Mechanics](lung)  
**Simple spirometry**:
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> >1.5 for lobectomy
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> >2 for pneumonectomy
* Lung parenchymal function  
Predicted post-operative lung function, as predicted by complex spirometry: 
	* PPO DLCO >40% and PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> >40%  
	Consider V/Q scan if DLCO is low. 
* Cardio-pulmonary reserve  
As measured by **CPET**, or surrogate:
	* VO<sub>2</sub> max >15mL/kg/min  
	Most useful predictor of outcome. Indicated by:
		* Stair climb ⩾2 flights
		* 6 minute walk test ⩾610m
		* Exercise SpO<sub>2</sub> <4%


###Predicted Post-Operative FEV<sub>1</sub>
Estimate of lung function:
* Calculated as $$PPO FEV_1 = Preoperative \ FEV_1 \times {Number \ of \ segments \ initially - Number \ of segments \ resected \over Number \ of \ segments \ initially}$$
* Assumes that all lung segments contribute equally to function  
Usually not the case as diseased units will inherently perform less well.
* Normal is **19 segments**


###Risk Stratification
Elevated risk seen with:
* Abnormal blood gases  
Historically used, but convey increase risk if:
	* PaO<sub>2</sub> >60mmHg
	* PaCO<sub>2</sub> <45mmHg
* VO<sub>2</sub>max <15mL/kg/min have very high morbidity and mortality
	* VO<sub>2</sub>max >20mL/kg/min have few respiratory complications
