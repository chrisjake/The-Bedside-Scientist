#Torniquets

Intraoperative torniquets:
* Are used in extremity surgery to improve operating conditions  
Provide a (mostly) bloodless surgical field (bleeding may still occur from intramedullary vessels).
* May be contraindicated in peripheral vascular disase
* Should be inflated above the **limb occlusion pressure**
	* Determinted by inflating the torniquet and monitoring arterial flow with doppler  
	Typically higher than SBP as torniquet pressure is not transmitted evenly to deeper structures.
	* A safety margin of 40-80mmHg should then be added
* Should generally not be used for longer than 1.5-2 hours in a healthy adult  
ATP stores are exhausted after this point.
	* Torniquet can be released for 10-15 minutes to allow ischaemic washout and reoxygenation prior to re-exsanguination and reinflation


##Local Effects of Torniquets
Include:
* Muscle
	* Ischaemia  
	Necrosis may occur after 2 hours
	* Post-torniquet syndrome  
	Swollen, pale, stiff, and weak limb for 1-6 hours after torniquet application.
		* May lead to compartment syndrome
* Nerve  
	* Temporary neuropathy  
	Conduction block develops after 15-45 minutes.
	* Permanent neuropathy  
	Exceedingly rare. Most neurological complications resolve within 6 months.
		* Pressure used is more significant than torniquet time
* Vascular injury  
Permanent vascular injury is rare but catastrophic, and probably involves torniquet pressure rupturing atheromatous plaque.


##Systemic Effects of Torniquets
Include:
* CVS
	* Increased effective circulating volume following limb drainage and torniquet inflation  
	Bilateral thigh torniquets may increase effective volume by 15%.
		* May lead to cardiac failure
	* Hypertension  
	Gradual increase in BP seen with torniquet use.
		* Probably due to torniquet pain
* Pain  
Torniquet inflation leads to a dull aching pain. This pain:
	* May occur despite apparently adequate neuraxial anaesthesia  
	As the neuraxial block wears off, C-fibres will conduct dull pain though the patient remains insensate to sharp pain (due to ongoing A-fibre blockade).
	* Responds to 0.1-0.25mg/kg IV ketamine  
	Beware treating as it will resolve with torniquet deflation.
* Extremity
	* Temperature  
	Increased core temperature due to reduced heat loss from ischaemic limb, typically 0.5°C after 2 hours.


##Effects of Torniquet Deflation
Include:
* CVS
	* CVS instability  
	Seen on torniquet deflation, due to reactive hyperaemia and wash-out of anaerobic metabolites.
* Respiratory
	* Increased PaCO<sub>2</sub>  
	Occurs on torniquet deflation, may result in hyperventilation or hypercarbia (with subsequent changes to CNS blood flow).
* Extremity  
Decreased core temperature on torniquet deflation due to heat redistribution.
* Fluid and Electrolyte
	* Hyperlactataemia  
	On torniquet deflation.
	* Hyperkalaemia  
	On torniquet deflation.
* Haematological
	* Increased fibrinolysis
