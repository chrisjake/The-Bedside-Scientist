#Parkinson's Disease

Progressive chronic neurological disorder:
* Occurs due to 
* Characterised by:
	* Motor symptoms
	* Autonomic dysfunction
	* Bulbar dysfunction
	* Dementia

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Prevalence:
* Highly prevalent once over 50  
Lifetime risk:
	* Men: 2%
	* Women: 1.3%
* Second-most common neurodegenerative condition  
Following Alzheimer disease.


##Pathophysiology
Histologically characterised by:
* Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system  
60-80% loss required for motor symptoms to be present.
* Lewy bodies in brainstem


###Aetiology
Multifactorial:
* Genetic   
5-10%.
* Environmental
	* Pesticides
	* Heavy metals
	* Well water
	* Woodworking
	* Head injury
	* Carbon monoxide

##Clinical Manifestations
**Four** cardinal symptoms:
* Tremor  
Rhythmic oscillation around a fixed point in the rest position.
	* Often first symptom
	* Usually a resting tremor
	* Characteristics include:
		* Asymmetrical  
		Bilateral once deterioration occurs.
		* Supination/pronation
		* "Pill-rolling"
* Rigidity
* Bradykinesia  
Slowness of movement. May be:
	* Initiation
	* Continuation
* Postural instability  
Balance dysfunction.
	* Major cause of falls, and subsequent injury and loss of independence




Secondary motor symptoms:
* Dyskinesia  
Involuntary, prolonged muscle contractions with abnormal posturing.
	* Usually occurs when dopamine levels are low  
	SUch as early morning.
* Motor fluctuations  
Times of poor response to levodopa, and associated with advancing disease.
* Reduced arm swing
* Decreased blink rate
* Masked facies
* Decreased voice volume
* Difficulty turning over


> Non-motor symptoms may also fluctuate:
> * In off states: Poorer mood, and dysautonomia
> * In on states: Mania, agitation, delusions, paranoid, impulsivity

Autonomic dysfunction:
* Orthostatic hypotension
* Constipation
* Incontinence
* Nausea/Vomiting


Neuropsychiatric manifestations:
* Mood disorders
	* Depression
	* Anxiety
	* Apathy
* Impulse control
* Psychosis
* Hallucinations
* Panic attacks
* Executive dysfunction
* Dementia


##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
Remains a clinical diagnosis.

##Investigations
##Management
>* Therapy targeted to symptoms
>* Dopaminergic replacement when symptoms become bothersome
>* Surgical treatment is indicated when motor symptoms are unable to be ameliorated by medication


###Medical
* Levodopa  
Dopamine precursor.
	* Gold standard
	* Administered with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g. carbidopa) to reduce peripheral breakdown and nausea  
	Variable preparations:
		* Immediate release
		* Extended release
		* Orally disintegrating tablet
		* Gel for PEG administration
	* Effective for rigidity and akinesia
	* Variable effects on tremor
	* Treatment does not worsen disease progression but high daily doses and long duration of *disease* is associated with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias
	* Benefit decreases as disease worsens  
	Reduced storage and release of dopamine limits utility of levodopa therapy.
* Dopamine agonists  
Directly agonise receptors, bypassing degenerating dopaminergic neurones.
	* Used as monotherapy or adjuncts
	* Longer half-life
	* Increased incidence of psychiatric side effects
	* Agents included:
		* Pramipexole
		* Ropinirole
		* Rotigotine
		* Apomorphine  
		Rescue medication given subcutaneously.
* COMT inhibitors  
Reduce levodopa breakdown.
	* Used in conjunction with levodopa
	* May increase dyskinesia
	* Include:
		* Entacapone
		* Tolcapone
* MAO-B inhibitors  
Reduce levodopa breakdown.
	* Include:
		* Selegiline  
		Selective, irreversible; used as an adjunct.
		* Rasagiline  
		Monotherapy or adjunct.

###Surgical
Deep Brain Stimulation:
* Modulation of brain circuitry via electrical stimulation
* Improves tremor, dyskinesia, and motor fluctuations

###Anaesthetic Considerations

* A
	* Potential difficult airway
		* Cervical spine rigidity
		* TMJ dysfunction
	* Aspiration
		* **Bulbar dysfunction**  
		* Oesophageal dysfunction  
		Bradykinesia and pharyngeal rigidity increases aspiration risl.
		* Gastroparesis
		* Sialorrhoea
* B
	* Chest wall rigidity
* C
	* **Autonomic instability**
* D
	* Parkinsonian medications  
	Medication management is critical.
		* Continue anti-Parkinson's drugs perioperatively
			* Give up to the time of surgery  
			Except prior to deep brain stimulator placement.
			* Restart as soon as possible after surgery
		* Avoid dopamine antagonists
			* Metoclopramide
			* Typical antipsychotics  
			Droperidol, haloperidol.
			* Phenothiazines  
			Chlorpromazine.
		* **MAO-I** use  
		Selegiline.
	* Opioids  
		* Muscle rigidity
		* Dystonic reactions
	* **Dementia**
* E
	* **Motor function**

###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
##Prognosis
Progression subdivided into three stages:
* Preclinical phase  
Asymptomatic neurodegeneration.
* Prodromal phase  
Symptoms present but insufficient for diagnosis.
* Clinical phase  
Symptoms manifest and recognisable.
