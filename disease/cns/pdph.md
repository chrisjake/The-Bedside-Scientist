#Post-Dural Puncture Headache
PDPH is **postural** headache occuring as a complication of neuraxial anaesthesia. PDPH is divided into:
* Mild PDPH  
No affect on daily activities, responds to non-opioid analgesia.
* Moderate PDPH  
Predominantly bedridden, requires opioids.
* Severe PDPH  
Completely bedridden, associated symptoms, no response to conservative therapy.


##Epidemiology


##Pathophysiology
Puncture of the dura causes CSF to leak into the epidural space, reducing CSF volume. This causes

##Clinical Features
* CSF leak from Tuohy needle during epidural insertion

##Investigations


##Management
* Placement of (a **clearly labelled**) intrathecal catheter  
Response to witnessed CSF leak from Tuohy needle during epidural insertion.
	* Leave catheter in situ for 24 hours  
	Aids inflammatory response and healing of dural puncture.
	* Reduces need for blood patch  
	59% to 33%.


* Conservative approach  
Mild and moderate PDPH.
	* Bed rest
	* Analgesia


* Epidural blood patch  
Placement of patients own blood in epidural space, which clots and prevents futher CSF leakage.
	* 70-90% efficacy
	* Indications:
		* Severe PDPH
	* Contraindications:
		* Systemic fever
		* Systemic infection
		* Local infection
		* Coagulopathy
	* Risks:
		* Failure
		* Back pain
		* Dural puncture
		* Nerve injury
		* Infection
			* Abscess
			* Meningitis
	* Process
		* Aseptic technique  
		Including blood draw.
		* Epidural puncture at or 1 level below the original site
		* 10-30ml of blood injected  
		Stop if radicular pain occurs.

###Ineffective Therapies
* Caffeine
* 5-HT
* ACTH
* Epidural saline
