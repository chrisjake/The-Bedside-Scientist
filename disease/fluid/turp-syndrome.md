#TURP Syndrome

Describes cardiac and neurological changes that occur due to systemic absorption of glycine, leading to toxicity due to:
* Rapid changes in:
	* Osmolality
	* Circulating volume
* CNS activity  

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Mostly related to rate of absorption:
	* Operating time  
	⩾1 hour.
	* Low venous pressure
		* Hypovolaemia
		* Hypotension
	* Extensive bleeding
	* Capsular performation
	* High irrigation fluid pressure


##Pathophysiology
Due to systemic absorption of 1.5% glycine
* Hypoosmolar: 220mosmol/kg
* Rapid changes in:
	* Osmolality  
	Effects mostly due to hypoosmolality, rather than hyponatraemia.
	* Circulating volume
* Direct neurological effects of glycine  
Acts as major inhibitory neurotransmitter in CNS


##Assessment
Timing:
* Intraoperatively  
Within 15 minutes.
* Post-operatively  
Up to 24 hours.

Presentation:
* Early:
	* Headache
	* Restlessnes
	* Dyspnoea
	* Burning sensation in face and hands
	* Visual disturbance  
	Mainly due to glycine.
* Late/severe:
	* Hypoxia
	* Pulmonary oedema
	* Nausea/vomiting
	* Confusion/convulsions/coma


##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
**Abandon surgery**.

Correct:
* Volume changes
	* Cease IV fluid
	* Frusemide  
	Only recommended if APO is present, as it will worsen hyponatraemia.
* Solute changes
	* 3% NaCl  
	Indicated if:
		* Serum sodium is ⩽120mmol/L
		* Severe neurological symptoms
			* Transient blindness
			* Persistent nausea/vomiting
			* Severe headaches
			* Severe hypotension


Supportive therapy:
* Bradycardia  
	* Atropine
	* Adrenaline
* Seizures  
	* Benzodiazepines
	* Magnesium  
	May be considered if refractory.

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* C
	* Arterial line  
	Recommended if managing as TURP syndrome.
	* Consider CVC
	
##Complications
##Prognosis
Associated with significant harm:
* Morbidity ~20%
* Mortality ~1%
