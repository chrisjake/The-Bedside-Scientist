#Hyponatraemia {#id}

Hyponatraemia is defined as a serum sodium level \<135mmol/L, and is further divided by serum concentrations and symptoms into:
* Mild
* Moderate
* Severe

Hyponatraemia may also be divided by time course:
* Acute  
\<48 hours.
* Chronic  
>48 hours.

##Pathophysiology
Hyponatraemia is a disorder of water excess. Broadly, this may be either due to:
* Excessive water intake
* Failure of the kidneys to remove water


##Investigations
Blood:
* Serum osmolality  
	* Normal >280mOsm/L
* Arterial blood gases  
* UECs
	* Potassium
	* Chloride
	* Bicarbonate
	* Glucose
	* Creatinine
	* Urea
* Cholesterol
	* Triglycerides
* Protein
* Random cortisol
* Short synacthen test


Urine:
* Urine osmolality
	* \<100mOsm/L indicates (appropriate) suppression of ADH  
	This is an appropriate response to hyponatraemia, as the body is in a state of water excess. 
* Urine sodium  
Indicates how the kidneys are handling sodium.
	* 10mmol/L is the theoretical minimum
	* \<20mmol/L suggests hypovolaemia  
	May be true hypovolaemia, or a percieved hypovolaemia (e.g. heart failure)
	* >40mmol/L suggests SIADH  
	Key in discriminating CSW and hypovolaemia from SIADH.

			* Ciprofloxacin
			* 
* Medical History
	* Ascites
	* Peripheral oedema
	* Trauma
		* Pituitary injury/Cerebral Salt Wasting
	* Urine output
		* HONK
		* ATN
	* Recent procedures
		* TURP
		* IV contrast administration
* Social history
	* Alcohol intake

Examination:
* Volumne state

##Diagnostic Approach
> * Many different approaches have been described
> * The following approach is used because it doesn't require assessment of volume state, which clinicians are generally bad at


1. Measure serum osmolality
	* This allows exclusion of pseudo-hyponatraemic states
2. Measure urine osmolality and sodium  
Patients can then be classified into:
	* Sodium retainers/sodium wasters  
	**Sodium retainers have urinary sodium \<40mmol/L.**
	* Water retainers/water wasters  
	**Water retainers have urinary osmolality >100mmol/L.**


Causes of hyponatraemia can then be grouped into **six types**:
1. Hyper-osmotic hyponatramia  
High serum osmolality - pseudohyponatraemia.
	* Mannitol
	* Sorbitol
	* IV contrast
	* Hyperglycaemia
2. Iso-osmotic hyponatraemia  
Normal serum osmolality - pseudohyponatraemia.
	* Hyperlipidaemia
	* Hyperproteinaemia
	* Post-TURP hyponatraemia
	* Massive uraemia
3. Sodium retainers, water retainers  
Low serum osmolality, high urine osmolality, low urine sodium - sodium and water are being retained.
	* Hypovolaemia
	* Heart failure  
	Consider TTE.
	* Cirrhosis  
	Consider LFTs.
	* Nephrotic syndrome  
	Consider 24 hour urinary protein.
4. Sodium wasters, water retainers  
Low serum osmolality, high urine osmolality, high urine sodium - sodium is being inappropriately lost, and water reabsorption mechanisms are intact.
	* Failure to reabsorb renal sodium
		* Diuretics
		* Polyuric ATN
		* Post-obstruction diuresis
		* Chronic renal failure
	* Mineralocorticoid deficiency  
	Consider cortisol level.
	* Hypothyroidism  
	Consider TFTs.
	* SIADH  
	Low urine output but euvolaemic.
	* Renal osmostat syndrome
	* Cerebral Salt Wasting  
	High urine output but hypovolaemic.
5. Sodium retainers, water wasters  
Low serum osmolality, low urine osmolality, low urinary sodium - water excretion is normal but water intake is excessively high.
	* Polydipsia/Excess IV water
	* Malnutrition/Beer potomania
6. Sodium wasters, water wasters  
Low serum osmolality, low urine osmolality, high urinary sodium - failure of water and sodium reabsorption.
	* Renal sodium loss
		* Post-obstructive diuresis
		* Polyuric ATN
		* AKI
