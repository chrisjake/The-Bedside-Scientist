#Amniotic Fluid Embolism

>* **Manage A-B-Cs**
>* **Prepare for impending DIC**


Embolism of amniotic fluid and foetal cells into the maternal circulation. May lead to profound shock and death via obstructive and distribute shock, occurring in two phases:
* **Phase 1: Right Heart Dysfunction**  
Increased PVR and right heart dysfunction due to spasm of the pulmonary artery by biochemical mediators.
	* Lasts 30-60 minutes
	* High mortality
* **Phase 2: Left heart failure**  
LV failure/APO.
	* May be due to direct pulmonary depression of mediators

##<span style="color:red">Emergency Management</span>
**Aggressive supportive measures**:
* Airway
	* Generally early intubation
* Breathing
	* May require bronchodilators  
	Note uterine tone.
* Circulation  
Rapid establishment of:
	* Invasive pressure monitoring
	* Aggressive filling
	* Vasopressors
	* Pulmonary vasodilators
	* Mechanical support  
	Includes:
		* CPB
		* ECMO
		* IABP

**Early consultation with**:
* Haematology
* Intensive care

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Epidemiology of AFE:
* Occurs in ~1:8000-80,000 pregnancies
* Has high mortality  
	* Maternal mortality 37-80%  
	Decreasing over time as resuscitation has improved.
	* Foetal mortality ~20%
* Has high neurological morbidity  
	* Maternal impediment ~7%
	* Foetal impediment 30-50%


Timing of AFE:
* 65-70% during active labour  
* 20% during LUSCS  
* 10% following vaginal delivery  
May occur up to 48 hours post-partum.

##Pathophysiology
AFE requires:
* Physical rupture of foetal membranes
* Amniotic fluid pressure to exceed venous pressure
	* Uterus unlikely portal of entry during contractions
	* Likely source is cervical or lower uterine segment tears
	* Late presentation may occur if fluid is compressed into circulation during movement or uterine involution
* Embolisation of amniotic fluid into maternal circulation  
Containing:
	* Foetal squamous epithelial cells
	* Vernix
	* Mucin
	* Meconium
	* Biochemical mediators
		* Endothelin
		* Leukotrienes
		* Prostoglandins
		* Thromboplastic
		* Tissue factor 

###Aetiology
##Clinical Features
**Rapid** and **severe** triad of:
* **Hypoxic respiratory failure**
* **Cardiogenic shock**
* **DIC**  
Occurs in basically all cases that survive the immediate cardiogenic shock.

May also present with:
* Bronchospasm
* Dysrrhythmias
* Foetal distress

###History
###Examination
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
Key differentials include other causes of shock, particularly:
* Obstructive shock
	* Pulmonary embolus
	* Air embolus
* Distributive shock
	* Sepsis
	* Anaphylaxis
* Cardiogenic shock
	* Peripartum cardiomyopathy
	* MI
	* LAST
* Hypovolaemic shock
	* Placental abruption


##Investigations
AFE is funamentally a clinical diagnosis. Key supportive investigations:
* FBE
* UEC/CMP
* Cardiac enzymes
* Coagulation assay
* Echocardiography  
TTE or TOE if available.
* ECG
* CXR

Investigations that have been used for diagnosis include:
* Maternal PA blood sampling for squamous epithelial cells  
Drawn from a wedged PAC.
* Histological analysis of cervix  
If a hysterectomy has been performed

##Management
###Anaesthetic Considerations
###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
##Prognosis
* High mortality  
Especially in initial periods.
* Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema  
Develops in 70% of survivors after LV function improves.
