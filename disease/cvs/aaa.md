#Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

Permanent dilatation **>30mm** of the aorta.

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Risk factors include:
* Family hisotry
* Smoking  
Most important modifiable risk factor - cessation reduces growth by 15-20%.
* Race  
Increased in caucasians.

Size correlates strongly with risk of rupture:
* Aneurysms >5.5 cm have an 18% annual rupture risk in women, and 12% in men
