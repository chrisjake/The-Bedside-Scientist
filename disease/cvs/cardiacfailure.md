#Cardiac Failure

Cardiac failure is a syndrome describing the impediment to ventricular filling or ejection due to structural or functional myocardial disease. Cardiac failure is usually classified by:
* Time-course
	* Acute
	* Chronic
* Ejection fraction
	* Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (> 50%)
	* Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (< 40%)
	* (An EF of 40-49% is typically called a mid-range EF)

Classifications include both functional scores (NYHA) or disease progression (ACC/AHA):



##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
* Prevalence of chronic heart failure is ~2%  
	* < 2% in < 60 year-olds
	* > 10% in > 75 year-olds 
* Lifetime risk of disease is ~20%
* Annual mortality is 6-7% in patients with stable heart failure
	* Increases to 25%/year in hospitalised patients

##Pathophysiology
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction:


##Assessment
* Breathlessness  
Pulmonary congestion due to raised LAP.
* Orthopnoea  
Increased VR and pulmonary congestion in supine position.
* PND  
As orthopnoea, but with additional respiratory depression.
* Pulmonary oedema/Crepitations  
Classically bilateral, due to pulmonary congestion.
* Pleural effusion  
Fluid retention and elevated LAP/RAP.


* Palpitations  
Tachyarrythmias and reduced exercise tolerance.
* Peripheral oedema  
Fluid retention and increased CVP.
* Elevated JVP  
Increased RAP.
* Displaced apex beat  
LV dilatation.


* Hepatomegaly  
Increased RAP.
* Hepatojugular reflex  
Increased RAP.
* Ascites  
Fluid retention.
* Cachexia  
Intestinal congestion, chronic inflammatory pathway activation.
* Early satiety  
Fluid retention.
* Anorexia  
Fluid retention.


* Fatigue  
Reduced skeletal muscle perfusion.
