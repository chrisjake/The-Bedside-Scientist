#Aortic Stenosis

Aortic stenosis occurs when valvular disease impedes blood flow across the valve during ventricular systole. The aortic valve is:
* Normally 2.6-3.5cm<sup>2</sup>  
Haemodynamically significant obstruction occurs when AVA approaches 1cm<sup>2</sup>.


AS is classified based on echocardiographic findings, using either:
* Aortic valve area
* Aortic valve pressure gradient/peak flow  
Dependent upon flow across the valve, and so will underpredict severity in failure states.
	* Pressure gradients are calculated by measuring flow across the valve, using the **simplified Benoulli equation:** $$ \Delta P = 4v^2$$  
		* Peak gradients are calculated from peak flow during ejection
		* Mean gradients are calculated by the average flow (area under the doppler envelope) during ejection


|Technique|Mild|Moderate|Severe|Critical|
|--|---|
|Valve Area|1.2-1.8cm<sup>2</sup>|0.8-1.2cm<sup>2</sup>|0.6-0.8cm<sup>2</sup>|< 0.6cm<sup>2</sup>|
|Mean Pressure Gradient|12-25mmHg|25-40mmHg|40-50mmHg|>50mmHg|
|Peak velocity|2.5-3m/s|3-4m/s|>4m/s||
|Dimensionless Index|0.5-0.75|0.25-0.5|<0.25||

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Risk factors include:
* Male
* CAD risk factors
	* DM
	* Hypercholesterolaemia
	* Smoking
	* Hypertension
	* Haemodialysis  
	Occurs in 10%.

##Pathophysiology
In aortic stenosis:
* LV responds to obstruction by undergoing hypertrophy  
Allows pressure gradient across the valve to be maintained without:
	* Reduction in SV
	* Ventricular dilation


* LVH leads to stiffening of the ventricle  
Subsequent diastolic dysfunction.
	* Hypertrophied ventricle more dependent on atrial kick
* LVH increases oxygen requirements, whilst increasing LV diastolic pressures reduce coronary blood flow and oxygen delivery  
Susceptible to ischaemia, especially when CO is high, even in absence of coronary artery disease.


* LA hypertrophy/dilation may occur to maintain filling


###Aetiology
AS may be caused by:
* Degenerative calcification  
Mechanical stress leading to progressive fibrosis and calcification.
	* Most common cause
	* Typically in those over 70
	* Initially occurs as sclerosis  
	Thickening/calcification of leaflets without stenosis.
* Congenital bicuspid valve  
Most common congenital cardiac malformation.
	* Typically symptomatic in 40-60 year olds  
	Accounts for 50% of AVR performed for AS in those under 70.


##Clinical Manifestations
Symptoms:
* Include:
	* Angina  
	Due to mismatch between LV oxygen consumption and demand.
	* Syncope  
	Late and bad sign. Occurs due to inadequate cardiac output, and may be related to either:
		* Increased demand in the setting of a relatively fixed cardiac output
		* Arrhythmia
	* Dyspnoea  
	Due to LV failure, and typically occurs in late disease (as it represents a failure of LV compensation.)
* Do not correlate well with anatomical severity

Signs:
* Slow rising, low volume pulse
* Reduced SBP and pulse pressure
* Ejection systolic murmur
	* Peaks in late systole
	* Radiates to carotids and to apex
	* May disappear in LV failure as flow through the valve orifice decreases


##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
ECG:
* Normal in ~20%
* LAD
* LVH  
* AV block  
Secondary to AV nodal calcium infiltration (extending from the aortic annulus).


Echocardiography:
* 2D exam  
Identifies thickening, impaired mobility, congenital abnormalities, and calcification of valve leaflets.

##Management
###Anaesthetic Considerations
* C
	* Lesion assessment  
	Preoperative TTE ideal to evaluate degree of stenosis and LV function.
		* If unable to evaluate preoperatively, treat as if patient has at least moderate severity disease
		* Impairment can be estimated by knowing that valve area reduces by ~0.1cm<sup>2</sup>/year
	* **Defend perfusion pressure**  
		* Vasopressor infusions with aggressive use of boluses
		* Use neuraxial techniques with caution
	* Invasive arterial monitoring


###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
Extensive cardiac remodelling, including:
* LVH
* LV diastolic dysfunction
* LA dilation
* MR  
Due to annular dilatation.
* PHTN
