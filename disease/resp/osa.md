###Anaesthetic Considerations
* A
	* CPAP available  
	Ensure CPAP or BiPAP device that the patient uses is brought to hospital and used perioperatively.
* B
	* Significantly increased risk of perioperative pulmonary complications including:
		* Aspiration pneumonia
		* ARDS
		* PE
	* Treatment prior to surgery may decrease perioperative risk
	* Perioperative respiratory monitoring is reasonable  
	Lacks strong evidence base.
* D
	* Note that anxiolytics and hypnotics may preciptiative airway collapse
	* No clear evidence for general anaesthesia or regional anaesthesia (or vice versa)
