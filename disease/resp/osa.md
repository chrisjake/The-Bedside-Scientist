#Obstructive Sleep Apnoea

Sleep disorder defined as **cessation of airflow for more than 10 seconds**:
* Despite ventilatory effort
* Occurring 5 or more times per hour of sleep
* With associated ↓ in SpO<sub>2</sub> of ⩾4%



##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Risk factors for OSA include:
* Severe obesity  
Major risk factor.
* Male
* Middle-aged
* Alcohol use
* Sedative use

Non-obese individuals with sleep apnoea usually have another structural problem, such as:
* Craniofacial abnormality
	* Micrognathia
	* Pierre Robin sequence
	* Down syndrome
	* Marfan syndrome
	* Acromegaly
* Tonsillar hypertrophy
* Chronic nasal obstruction

##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
##Assessment
Patients (or partners) may complain of:
* Snoring
* Daytime somnolence
* 

##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
Polysomogram is:
* Diagnostic
* Used to grade severity  
Given as the **apnoea-hypopnoea index** (AHI), the **total number of apnoeas or hypopnoeas per hour of sleep**.
	* Mild: 6-20
	* Moderate: 21-40
	* Severe: ⩾40
* A highly involved study
	* Waiting lists may be extensive
* An evaluation of multiple parameters:
	* Infrared camera  
	Monitors body position.
	* Airway microphone  
	Monitors airflow.
	* SpO<sub>2</sub>  
	* Chest girth measurement  
	Evaluates respiratory effort.
	* EEG  
	For monitoring of sleep cycles.
	* Electrooculogram  
	Monitors eye movement to separate REM from non-REM sleep.
	* ECG  
	Monitors cardiac activity.
	* Chin EMG  
	Upper airway muscle activity.
	* Leg EMG  
	Monitors leg movements.


##Management
###Anaesthetic Considerations
* A
	* CPAP available  
	Ensure CPAP or BiPAP device that the patient uses is brought to hospital and used perioperatively.
	* Difficult airway  
	Intubation difficult in 10-25%.
* B
	* Significantly increased risk of perioperative pulmonary complications including:
		* Aspiration pneumonia
		* ARDS
		* PE
	* Treatment prior to surgery may decrease perioperative risk
	* Perioperative respiratory monitoring is reasonable  
	Lacks strong evidence base.
* D
	* No clear evidence for general anaesthesia or regional anaesthesia (or vice versa)
	* Sensitive to CNS depressants: may preciptiative airway collapse
		* Anaesthetic agents
		* Benzodiazepines
		* Opioids

###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
Hypoxaemia and hypercarbia in severe OSA has several cardiovascular sequelae:
* Arrhythmia  
Due to changed autonomic tone.
	* Bradycardia
	* Second-degree heart block
	* Ventricular ectopy
* Pulmonary hypertension
	* Directly  
	Due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.
	* Indirectly
		* Increased sympathetic tone  
		Due to hypoxia.
		* Increased transmural pressure from more neagative intrathoracic pressure due to inspiratory effort against upper airway obstruction
