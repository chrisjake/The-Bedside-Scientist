#Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

COPD is a chronic, progressive inflammatory condition of the lung. COPD:
* Affects airways, lung parenchyma, and vasculature
* Impairs expiration via:
	* Poorly reversible airway narrowing
	* Airway smooth muscle remodelling
	* Increasing mucous production
* 


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Environmental exposures:
* **Cigarette smoking**

Genetic factors:
* FAM13A associated with development

##Pathophysiology
Expiratory airflow limitation via:
* Obstructive bronchiolitis  
Small airway inflammation leads to gas trapping and dynamic hyperinflation.
* Parenchymal destruction  
Leading to emphysema, which reduces:
	* Pulmonary capillary bed volume
	* Lung surface area for gas exchange
	* V/Q matching

###Aetiology
##Assessment
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
Diagnosis should be considered in:
* Smokers
* Age >35
* Exertional breathlessness
* Chronic cough
* Frequent winter bronchitis or wheeze

##Investigations
Respiratory function tests are diagnostic and used to grade severity:
* FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC of ⩽0.7
	* Reversibility is not required  
	Differentiated from asthma on clinical grounds.
* Severity graded by FEV<sub>1</sub>  
Multiple grading systems, the GOLD 2008/NICE 2010 system:
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> ⩾80% predicted  
	Mild.
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> 50-79% predicted  
	Moderate.
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> 30-49% predicted  
	Severe.
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> ⩽30% predicted  
	Very severe.



##Management
Includes:
* Smoking cessation  
Vital, and will slow down deterioration and disability before death occurs.
* Inhaled therapies  
Mainstay of day-to-day treatment. Includes:
	* Short-acting bronchodilators  
	For breathlessness and exercise limitation.
	* Long-acting bronchodilators  
	For persistent breathlessness.
* Oral therapy  
Oral corticosteroids may be required in advanced disease.

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* B
	* Smoking cessation  
	Patients are more receptive to smoking cessation perioperatively, and this should be encouraged.
	* Disease severity
		* Exercise tolerance
		* Number of exacerbations
		* Most recent course of antibiotics or steroids
		* Previous requirement for NIV or intubation
	* Wheezing  
	If present needs aggressive treatment with bronchodilators +/- steroids.
	* Active respiratory infection  
	Consider treatment and postponing surgery.
	* Consider CXR if:
		* Current infection
		* Recent deterioration in symptoms
	* Ventilator settings  
	Aim to minimise gas trapping:
		* Increase the I:E ratio to prolong expiratory time  
		Suggest 1:3-1:5.
			* May require increased inspiratory flow rate and higher Pip
		* Consider PEEP  
		Aim to splint open small airways, and if ePEEP < iPEEP then worsening of CV effects will not occur.
		* Bronchospasm

* C
	* Pulmonary hypertension
	* Concomitant IHD
* D
	* General anaesthesia  
	Increased risk, particularly with intubation and IPPV, of:
		* Laryngospasm
		* Bronchospasm
		* Barotrauma
		* Hypoxaemia
		* Cardiovascular instability
	* Regional anaesthesia
* E
	* Neuromuscular blockade  
		* Ensure complete reversal prior to extubation
		* Consider extubation directly onto NIV  
		Reduces need for post-operative reintubation.
