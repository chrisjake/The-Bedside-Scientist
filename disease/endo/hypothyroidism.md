##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
###Anaesthetic Considerations
* A
	* Tracheal compression  
	Gotires may impinge on trachea and impede airway management.
* B
	* Reduced response to ↑ CO<sub>2</sub> and ↓ O<sub>2</sub>
* C
	* Bradydysrhythmias
	* Diastolic HTN
	* Diastolic dysfunction
* E
	* Addisons disease  
	Occurs in 5-10% of patients with severe hypothyroidism.
* H
	* Anaemia

###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications

###Myxedema Coma
Exacerbation of hypothyroidism that:
* May be life threatening  
Mortality >50%.
* Manifests with:
	* Hypoventilation and subsequent hypoxia
	* Bradycardia and hypotension
	* Altered mental state  
	Apathy, coma.
	* Hyponatraemia
	* Hypothermia
* Requires emergent maagement with:
	* Supportive therapy
		* Intubation and ventilation  
		For hypoxia and hypoventilation.
		* Cautious volume expansion  
		For hypotension. Risk of APO.
		* Pacing or chronotropic agent  
		Again, cautiously.
		* Rewarming
		* Correction of BSL
	* Curative therapy
		* Thyroxine  
		200-500μg of L-thyroxine as loading dose, followed by 100-300μg the following day.
			* Monitor TSH level for response
		* Tri-iodothyronine  
		If thyroxine unavailable.
		* Hydrocortisone  
		100-300mg IV QID.
