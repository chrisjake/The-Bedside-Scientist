#Carcinoid

Neuroendocrine tumour that:
* May occur from any neuroendocrine cell  
Found in many tissues; tumour incidence depends on neuroendocrine cell density. May arise in:
	* Lung  
	~25%. Technically only neuroendocrine tumours of the lung should be called carcinoid tumours.
	* GIT  
	Should be referred to as neuroendocrine tumour (NET). May occur in:
		* Small intestine  
		40%.
		* Rectum  
		27%.
		* Stomach  
		10%.
* Contain neuroendocrine cells and secrete biological amines
	* Serotonin  
	Most commonly.
	* Corticotrophin
	* Histamine
	* Dopamine
	* Substance P
	* Neurotensin
	* Prostaglandins
	* Kallikrein

 

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
##Pathophysiology
Derived from neuroendocrine cells:
* Enterochromaffin cells
* Kulchitsky cells

* Frequency of occurrence related to neuroendocrine cell density


###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
>* Many are asymptomatic and found incidentally due to long lead time to diagnosis
>* Average time from diagnosis to symptoms is 8 years

Presentation may be from **mass effect** or **carcinoid syndrome**, and varies depending on location:
* Pulmonary
	* Pneumonia
	* Cough
	* Haemoptysis
	* Chest pain
* Gastric
	* Zollinger-Ellison syndrome  
	Peptic ulcers occurring due to excessive acid production, in turn occurring due to a gastrin-producing tumour.
	* Atrophic gastritis
* Bowel
	* Mass effect
		* Obstruction
		* Abdominal pain


###Carcinoid Syndrome
Syndrome associated with secretion of vasoactive mediators from the tumour. Carcinoid syndrome is:
* Rare  
~10% of patients with carcinoid tumours.
* Unpredictable clinical effects  
Variable:
	* Secretion of (usually) histamine and serotonin
	* First-pass hepatic metabolism  
	Depending on location.
* Usually **intermittent** symptoms  
Associated with:
	* Exercise
	* Tyramine ingestion  
	Cheese, chocolate.
* Common symptoms:
	* Flushing
	* Diarrhoea
* Less common symptoms:
	* Lacrimation
	* Rhinorrhoea


###Carcinoid Heart Disease
Development of characteristic cardiac lesions, associated with high circulating 5-HT. Classically **right-sided endocardial thickening**:
* Leads to retraction and fixation of valve leaflets
* TR near-universal
* TS, PR, and PS may occur
* Left sided disease may occur in the presence of an intracardiac shunt (e.g. PFO), that leads to serotonin entering left-sided chambers

###Carcinoid Crises
Exaggerated form of carcinoid syndrome that is:
* Potentially fatal
* Associated with medical intervention
* Characterised by:
	* Profound flushing
	* Bronchospasm
	* Tachycardia
	* Widely fluctuating BP  
* Requires octreotide to control haemodynamics  
0.5-1mg IV followed by infusion of 50-200μg/hr.


##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
Urine:
* 5-HIAA  
Serotonin metabolite; requires 24 hour urine collection.

CT:
* For identifying presence of metastases

##Management
###Medical
###Surgical
###Anaesthetic Considerations
* B
	* CXR if pulmonary
* C
	* ECG
	* TTE
	* Cardiac disease
		* **Carcinoid cardiac disease**
		* **Coronary spasm**
		* **Erratic BP**  
		Hypo- or hypertensive crises may:
			* Occur due to variation in hormone secretion
			* **Unresponsive** to **conventional vasoactives**
	* Haemodynamic goals
		* Deep, stable anaesthesia prior to resection
		* **Avoid**:
			* Morphine
			* Atracurium
			* Suxamethonium
		* Low CVP during resection
		* Avoid inotropes and vasopressors  
		Unpredictable and potentially **paradoxical** response.
			* Noradrenaline may release kallikrein from tumour, leading to vasodilation
			* Exaggerated hypertension also described
			* Vasopressin is appropriate to use as a vasopressor, if required.
			* Short-acting α-blockade ideal for managing persistent hypertension
* D
	* Consider epidural  
	Reduce pain and vasoactive release.
* E
	* **Octreotide** infusion  
	Used to limit vasoactive crises. Octreotide:
		* Dosing
			* 50μg/hr for at least 12 hours pre-operatively
			* Aggressive redosing (50μg bolus) if ongoing evidence of excessive secretion
		* Has many effects, however its key:
			* Mechanism of action is via:
				* Reducing splanchnic blood flow
				* Reducing secretion of vasoactive peptides
			* Adverse effects include:
				* Conduction defects
					* QT prolongation
					* Bradycardia
				* Abdominal cramps


###Ineffective Therapies

##Prognosis
Death:
* 70% 5 year survival
