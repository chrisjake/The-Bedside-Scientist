#Carcinoid

Neuroendocrine tumour that:
* May occur from any neuroendocrine cell  
Found in many tissues; tumour incidence depends on neuroendocrine cell density. May arise in:
	* Small intestine  
	40%.
	* Rectum  
	27%.
	* Stomach  
	10%.
	* Bronchopulmonary tree  
	~25%.
* Contain neuroendocrine cells and secrete biological amines
	* Serotonin  
	Most commonly.
	* Corticotrophin
	* Histamine
	* Dopamine
	* Substance P
	* Neurotensin
	* Prostaglandins
	* Kallikrein

 

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
##Pathophysiology
Derived from neuroendocrine cells:
* Enterochromaffin cells
* Kulchitsky cells

* Frequency of occurrence related to neuroendocrine cell density


###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
>* Many are asymptomatic and found incidentally due to long lead time to diagnosis
>* Average time from diagnosis to symptoms is 8 years

Presentation varies depending on location:
* Pulmonary
	* Pneumonia
	* Cough
	* Haemoptysis
	* Chest pain
* Gastric
	* Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
	* Atrophic gastritis
* Bowel
	* Mass effect
		* Obstruction
		* Abdominal pain


###Carcinoid Syndrome
Syndrome associated with secretion of vasoactive mediators from the tumour. Carcinoid syndrome is:
* Rare  
~10% of patients with carcinoid tumours.
* Unpredictable clinical effects  
Variable:
	* Secretion of (usually) histamine and serotonin
	* First-pass hepatic metabolism  
	Depending on location.
* Usually **intermittent** symptoms  
Associated with:
	* Exercise
	* Tyramine ingestion  
	Cheese, chocolate.
* Symptoms include
	* Flushing
	* Diarrhoea
	* Lacrimation
	* Rhinorrhoea
	* Right-sided valvular heart disease  
	Retraction and fixation of valve leaflets.
		* Occurs due to chronic elevation of 5-HT
		* Occurs in 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of carcinoid syndrome
		* Increases perioperative complications


###Carcinoid Crises
Exaggerated form of carcinoid syndrome that is:
* Potentially fatal
* Associated with medical intervention
* Characterised by:
	* Profound flushing
	* Bronchospasm
	* Tachycardia
	* Widely fluctuating BP  



##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
Urine:
* 5-HIAA  
Serotonin metabolite; requires 24 hour urine collection.

CT:
* For identifying presence of metastases

##Management
###Medical
###Surgical
###Anaesthetic Considerations
* B
	* CXR if pulmonary
* C
	* ECG
	* TTE
	* Cardiac disease
		* Biventricular failure  
		* Valvular disease
			* TR
			* PS
		* **Coronary spasm**
		* **Erratic BP**  
		Hypo- or hypertensive crises may:
			* Occur due to variation in hormone secretion
			* **Unresponsive** to **conventional vasoactives**
	* Haemodynamic goals
		* Deep, stable anaesthesia prior to resection
		* **Avoid**:
			* Morphine
			* Atracurium
			* Suxamethonium
		* Low CVP during resection
		* Avoid inotropes and vasopressors  
		Unpredictable and potentially **paradoxical** response.
			* Noradrenaline may release kallikrein from tumour, leading to vasodilation
			* Exaggerated hypertension also described
			* Vasopressin is appropriate to use as a vasopressor, if required.
			* Short-acting α-blockade ideal for managing persistent hypertension
* D
	* Consider epidural  
	Reduce pain and vasoactive release.
* E
	* **Octreotide** infusion  
	Used to limit vasoactive crises. Octreotide:
		* Dosing
			* 50μg/hr for at least 12 hours pre-operatively
			* Aggressive redosing (50μg bolus) if ongoing evidence of excessive secretion
		* Has many effects, however its key:
			* Mechanism of action is via:
				* Reducing splanchnic blood flow
				* Reducing secretion of vasoactive peptides
			* Adverse effects include:
				* Conduction defects
					* QT prolongation
					* Bradycardia
				* Abdominal cramps


###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
##Prognosis
Death:
* 70% 5 year survival
