###Anaesthetic Considerations
* D
	* BSL  
	Significant attention must be given to perioperative management of blood glucose and hypoglycaemics.
		* Typical BSL targets may be 5-10 mmol/L
		* Key questions:
			* Is this patient insulin dependent?  
			More important than aetiology of diabetes.

####Perioperative Oral Hyoglycaemic Management
|Class|Generic Name|Recommendation|
|---|---|
|Biguanide|Metformin|Withold 24 hours pre-major surgery (risk of lactic acidosis)
|Sulphonylurea|Gliclazide, Glipizide, Glimepiride|Withold day of surgery|
|Glitazones|Rosiglitazone, Pioglitazone|Withold day of surgery|
|GLP-1 agonists|Exanatide|Withold day of surgery|
|DPP-4 inhibitors|Sitagliptin|Withold day of surgery

####Perioperative Insulin Management
Management of insulin depends on:
* The type of insulin
* The timing of the procedure
* Whether the patient is taking bowel preparation

|Type of Insulin|Trade Names|Day PRIOR to procedure|For an AM list|For a PM list|
|---|---|
|Short Acting|- Novorapid <br>- Humalog <br>- Actrapid<br>|- Usual doses<br>- **Half** usual dose during bowel **preparation**|- Withhold<br>- Give sliding scale|- Half usual dose with early morning breakfast|
|Intermediate Acting|- Protaphane <br>- Humulin NPH|- Give 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of usual dose<br>- **Half** usual dose during bowel **preparation**|- Withhold<br>- Give sliding scale|- Half usual dose with early morning breakfast|
|Long Acting/Basal|- Lantus<br>- Levemir|- Give 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of usual dose<br>- **Half** usual dose during bowel **preparation**|-  Give 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of usual dose<br>|- Give 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of usual dose<br>|
|Pre-mixed|- Novomix 30<br>- Humalog Mix 25/Humalog Mix 50<br>- Mixtard 30/70|- Give normal dose with dinner<br>- **Half** usual dose during bowel **preparation**|- Withhold<br>- Give sliding scale|- Half usual dose with early morning breakfast<br>- Give sliding scale|

#####Sliding Scales
Sliding scales should be based on the total daily insulin dose:

|BSL (mmol/L)|< 20 units/day|21-40 units/day|41-60 units/day|61-89 units/day|>90 units/day|
|--|--|
|**10-11.9**|1 unit|2 units|4 units|6 units|10 units|
|**12-15**|2 units|4 units|6 units|8 units|12 units|

**If BSL** is:
* < 4 mmol/L 
Notify anaesthetist and recheck BSL every 15 minutes
* < 10 mmol/L and the patient is fasting  
Give 5% dextrose at 100ml/hr.
* ≥ 10 mmol/L and the patient is fasting  
Consider 5% dextrose at 50-100ml/hr.


#####Continuous Subcutaenous Insulin Infusion Pumps
* Target a BSL of 5-10mmol/L  
Check BSL Q2H whilst fasting.
* Give 5% dextrose (as for sliding scale insulin) whilst fasting
* If BSL:
	* < 4 mmol/L  
	Withold insulin, consider giving additional glucose.
	* ≥ 4 mmol/L  
	Continue insulin infusion.
	* ≥ 10 mmol/L  
	Adminster additional short-acting insulin (as for sliding scale insulin).


###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications


###Obstetric Complications
Complications of maternal diabetes include:
* Placental insufficiency  
	* Uteroplacental blood flow is reduced 35-45%  
	Additional impairment if blood glucose control is poor.
	* Reduced oxygen transport on HbA<sub>1c</sub>
* Superimposed pre-eclampsia
* Diabetic ketoacidosis  
Major factor increasing perinatal morbidity and mortality.
* Increased foetal acidosis at delivery


Management considerations:
* Epidural reduces foetal metabolic acidosis
* Greater haemodynamic disturbance with spinal  
Likely due to higher sympathectomy.
