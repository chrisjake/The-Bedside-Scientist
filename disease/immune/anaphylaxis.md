#Anaphylaxis
more testy
*This covers both perioperative and non-perioperative anaphylaxis. Treatment recommendations for perioperative anaphylaxis are detailed separately, due to the nature of the disease (typically of more rapid onset and aggressive progression), and the immediate availability of resuscitation equipment and personell.*

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening emergency. It is an IgE mediated, immediate (type I) and systemic hypersensitivity reaction, characterised by a triad of:
* Hypotension
* Bronchospasm
* Rash

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Triggers of non-perioperative anaphylaxis:
* Food
	* 60% of anaphylaxis in children
	* 16% of anaphylaxis in adults
* Insect venoms
	* 16% of anaphylaxis in children
	* 55% of anaphylaxis in adults
* Drugs
	* 8% of anaphylaxis in children
	* 21% of anaphylaxis in adults


Perioperative anaphylaxis:
* 56% female
* Overall less common in paediatrics
	* May be due to less use of antibiotics and muscle relaxants
	* More likley to present with bronchospasm
* Causes
	* ~46% are antibiotic associated  
	Teicoplanin and amoxycillin-clavulanate have the highest risk.
	* ~33% are related to neuromuscular blocking drugs
		* Suxamethonium: ~11/100,000
		* Rocuronium: 6/100,000
		* Atracurium: 4/100,000
	* ~10% chlorhexidine  
	Typically presents more slowly, unless IV (i.e. chlorhexidine-impregnated CVC) source.
	* Patent Blue die  
	Highest risk single therapy at ~15/100,000.
* Isolated severe hypotension was typically managed most poorly

##Pathophysiology
Anaphylaxis is driven by degranualation of mas cells and basophil graculocytes, causing release of:
* Histamine
* Prostaglandins
* Leukotrienes
* Tryptase
* Platelet-activating factor
* Cytokines
* Chemokines


Non-allergic anaphylaxis:
* Describes a clinical appearance of anaphylaxis where immunological sensitisation has not been detected
* Probably relates to G-protein induced release of vasoactive mediators


##Clinical Features
Symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis:
* Typically occur acutely and progress rapidly
* Relate to involvement of different organ systems
* Relate to the region of the body affected  
Typically tissues with high concentrations of mast cells.
	* Skin  
		* Urticaria
		* Erythema
		* Angioedema
		* Airway swelling
	* Respiratory
		* Bronchospasm  
		Leading symptom in life-threatening reactions.
	* GIT
		* Nausea
		* Vomiting
		* Diarrhoea
	* CVS
		* Hypotension
		* Haemoconcentration  
		Due to interstitial oedema.
			* 35-70% of circulating volume may extravasate in 10-15 minutes


Prodromal symptoms:
* Itching
* Metallic taste
* Fearfullness
* Headache
* Disorientation


###Presentation of Perioperative Anaphylaxis
* Timing
	* ~80% occurs within 10 minutes of drug administration  
	Antibiotic-associated anaphylaxis typically occurs more rapidly and aggressively.
	* ~2% occurs after 60 minutes
* Features
	* Bronchospasm
		* Occurs in 50%
		* First feature in ~20%
		* Capnograph changes in ~30%
	* Skin signs  
	Uncommon in severe reactions.


###Classification
Anaphylaxis is classified into four grades, based on severity:
* **Grade 1 (Mild)**
	* Mucocutaneous signs only
	* Does not require treatment with adrenaline
	* Does require monitoring
* **Grade 2 (Moderate)**
	* Multi-organ manifestations  
	Typically:
		* Bronchospasm
		* Hypotension  
		Perioperatively, consider **hypotension out of proportion to what would be expected** by the drugs given or the operative stage.
		* Mucocutaneous signs  
		Typically allows differentition from isolated bronchospasm or other causes of hypotension.
* **Grade 3 (Life-threatening)**
	* Life threatening
		* Hypotension
		* Elevated airway pressures
	* Requires immediate treatment to avoid progression
	* **Cutaneous signs** frequently **absent** due to poor cardiac output state  
	May only appear following resuscitation.
* **Grade 4 (Cardiac arrest)**
	* Absence of palpable central pulse or grossly inadequate blood pressure
	* Management follows a ALS protocol  
	Consider more frequent use of adrenaline (Q1-2 minutely) and early initiation of vasopressors when initial therapy is inadequate.




###History
###Examination
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
Differential diagnoses include:
* Respiratory
	* Status asthmaticus
	* Airway foreign body
	* Laryngotracheitis
	* Tension pneumothorax
	* Acid aspiartion
	* Dislodged, kinked, or obstructed airway device
* CVS
	* Cardiogenic shock
	* Embolism
	* MI
* Endocrinological
	* Carcinoid syndrome
	* Pheochromocytoma
	* Thryotoxic crisis
	* Hypoglycaemia
* Skin diseases
	* Urticardia
	* Hereditary/acquired angioedema
* Toxins
	* Ethanol
	* Histaminosis


##Investigations
Serum tryptase:
* Should be measured at the 1 (as close as possible to onset), 4, and 24 hour mark  
	* Peak level typically occurs 15-120 minutes following reaction
	* Declines slowly within 3-6 hours  
	24 hour value gives a baseline level, which can then be used to identify whether there was substantial mast cell degranulation.




##Management
Principles of management include:
* IV fluid  
	* Volume resucitation  
	Reverses haemoconcentration due to interstitial oedema.
	* Can consider colloid, provided colloid was not given prior to onset of anaphylaxis
* Adrenaline
	* Key therapy
		* Prevents further mast cell degranulation
		* Bronchodilator
		* Vasoconstrictor
	* Doses may vary depend on patient factors
		* Increased risk of CVS compromise with overdose
			* Extremes of age
			* Hypertension
			* Ischaemic heart disease
			* Hyperthyroidism
		* Catecholamine resistance
			* β-blockade
			* ACE-I use
		* Catecholamine sensitivity
			* Amphetamines
			* Cocaine
	* Intramuscular
		* Appropriate when IV access is unavailable
		* Reduces chance of severe CVS side effects
		* Provides 'depot' for continued release  
		Up to 40 minutes.
	* Intravenous
		* Appropriate in severe anaphylaxis
* Glucagon
	* Recommended in patients on β-blockers

###Immediate Managment of Perioperative Anaphylaxis
*From the ANZCA/AANZAG guideline*  

Follows a DRSABCD approach:
* Danger
	* Remove triggers  
		* Chlorhexidine  
		Including impregnated CVCs.
		* Colloid
		* Latex
* Response
	* Commence ALS if grade IV anaphylaxis
* Send for help
	* Organise team
* Airway
	* Consider **early intubation**  
	Early administration of adrenalie may avoid the need for intubation, however if airway oedema is present then early consideration of intubation is appropriate.
* Respiratory
	* Provide 100% oxygen
* Circulation
	* Gain wide-bore IV access
	* Commence rapid infusion of warm IV fluids
	* Give **adrenaline**
		* If no IV access or haemodynamic monitoring  
		500ug IM Q5 minutes.
		* If IV access:
			* Grade 2  
			20ug bolus Q1-2 minutes as starting dose, titrated to effect.
			* Grade 3 (Life threatening)  
			100-200ug bolus Q1-2 minutes as starting dose, titrated to effect.
		* If >3 IV boluses required, commence infusion:  
		Peripheral infusion is acceptable in the short term prior to establishing CVC access.
			* Begin at 3ug/min
			* Titrate up to 40ug/min
	* Consider **arterial line insertion**
	* Consider **central line insertion**  
	If ongoing vasopressor requirement.
* Disability
	* Maintain anaesthesia  
	Consider processed EEG monitoring.


Monitoring and followup:
* Grade 3 and Grade 4 anaphylaxis requires admission to ICU/HDU for monitoring and ongoing therapy as required
* Grade 1 and 2 anaphylaxis which has settled quickly should be have at least 6 hours of close monitoring


* All patients require a letter containing descriptions of the reaction and agents administered



###Refractory Management of Perioperative Anaphylaxis
* Ensure triggers removed
* Reconsider arterial line
* Consider echocardiography
* **Resistant bronchospasm**
	* Consider additional diagnosis
		* Equipment malfunction
		* Tension pneumothorax
	* Continue adrenaline
	* Salbutamol
		* 100-200ug IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 5-25ug/min
		* 12 puffs MDI
	* Magnesium  
	2g over 20 minutes.
	* Inhalational anaesthetics
	* Ketamine
* **Resistant hypotension**
	* Additional IV fluid
	* Vasopressor
		* Noradrenaline or vasopressin rpreferred
	* Glucagon  
	In the setting of β-blockade.
		* 1-2mg IV Q5 min until CVS response is noted.

###Ineffective Therapies
* Sugammadex  
Has no role in the management of rocuronium anaphylaxis.

* Steroids  
No evidence that use of corticosteroids affects outcome.
	* May be reasonable as part of secondary management in a stable patient
	* May have a role in reducing rebound

* Antihistamines  
	* No role in acute phase
	* May be used for symptomatic management of urticardia, angioedema, and pruritis  
	Appropriate in mild anaphylaxis.
	* No effect on hypotension and bronchospasm
	* Oral agents have a preferred side-effect profile compared to IV


##Complications
* Cardiac arrest  
Bradycardic/PEA arrest is most common.
* Death  
Associated with:
	* Age
	* Obesity
	* Coronary artery disease
	* β-blockade

##Prognosis
Anaphylaxis can:
* Spontaneously resolve
* Progress despite adequate therapy
