#Necrotising Fasciitis

Necrotising fasciitis is an aggressive, life-threatening infection characterised by:
* Rapidly progressing necrosis of subcutaneous tissue and fascia  
Relative sparing of underlying muscle.
* Systemic toxicity with associated multi-organ failure and high mortality  
May be difficult to differentiate from a severe necrotising abscess or other necrotising soft tissue infection.
* Two subtypes
	* Polymicrobial necrotising fasciitis (Type 1)
	* Group A Strep necrotising fasciitis (Type 2)

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Predisposing factors for necrotising soft tissue infection include:
* Previous trauma
* Previous surgery
* Pre-existing infection
* Obesity
* Diabetes
* Smoking
* IV drug use
* Immunosuppression

Risk factors associated with increased mortality include:
* Age  
Especially in >70 age group.
* Illness severity
* Organism  
Higher mortality seen with:
	* Group A Streptococci
	* Enteric organisms

##Pathophysiology
Necrotising fasciitis involves
* Rapid proliferation of subcutaneous bacteria
* Leukococyte proliferation
* Thrombosis of fascial vessels  
Leads to ischaemia and necrosis of tissue.

##Investigations


##Management
Standard treatment involves:
* Aggressive surgical debridement of infection
* Antibiotics

More controversial therapies include:
* Hyperbaric oxygen therapy  
A retrospective review suggested that HBOT suggests patients are 4x less likely to die. Multiple suggested mechanisms:
	* Increases viability of marginal tissue
	* Reduces bacterial toxin prouction
	* Inhibits anaerobic bacterial growth  
	Increases tissue oxdiation reduction potential.
	* Potentiates antibiotic function
	* Improves efficacy of neutrophil respiratory burst
* Intravenous Immunoglobulin

###Ineffective Therapies


##Complications


##Prognosis
* 30% mortality
