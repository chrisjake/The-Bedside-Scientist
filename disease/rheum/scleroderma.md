#Systemic Sclerosis/Scleroderma

Chronic multisystem disease characterised by progressive fibrosis of organs. Subdivided by pattern of skin and internal organ involvement into:
* Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis  
Skin sclerosis distal to elbows and knees, and prominent vascular malformations.
* Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis  
Skin thickening proximal to elbows and knees, with early lung fibrosis and increased risk of renal and cardiac involvement.
* Systemic sclerosis without scleroderma
* Systemic sclerosis with overlap  
Any of the above may have features of another systemic rheumatic disease.
