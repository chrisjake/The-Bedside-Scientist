#von Willebrand Disease

von Willebrand Disease is a family of bleeding disorders caused by abnormal von Willebrand factor.
* vWF is a large glycoprotein that:
	* Acts as the **carrier protein** for **factor VIII**
	* Is required for platelet adhesion  
	Provides an adhesive bridge from platelet to damaged subendothelium.
* vWD:
	* May be:
		* Congenital  
		Divided into **three** subtypes:
			* Type 1  
			Quantitative reduction in normal vWF.
				* Mild clinical symptoms
				* Usually autosomal dominant
				* ~75% of patients
			* Type 2  
			Primarily **qualitative** defect.
				* 4 subtypes with varying degrees of severity
				* Autosomal dominant or recessive
			* Type III  
			Absent or severely reduced.
				* Severe clinical bleeding
				* Autosomal recessive
		* Acquired  
		May be:
			* Malignant 
				* Lymphoproliferative disease
				* Myeloproliferative neoplasms
				* Wilms tumour
				* Carcinomas
			* Immune
				* SLE
			* Vascular flow  
			Shear stress on vWF multimers increases susceptibility to cleavage by ADAMTS13.
				* AS
				* LVAD/ECMO
				* MV prolapse
				* Congenital heart disease
 			* Toxins
 				* Valproic acid
 				* Ciprofloxacin
 			* Other
 				* Hypothyroidism


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Most common hereditary bleeding disorder:
* Prevalence is ~1% worldwide  
However, only ~1% of these patients will display symptoms.

##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
##Clinical Manifestations
Bleeding:
* Mucocutaneous bleeding most common  
Usually type I and type II.
	* Dental procedures
* Minor surgery
	* Circumcision
* Menorrhagia
* PPH  
Usually secondary.

##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
> Majority of patients will have normal FBE and coagulation studies

* FBE
	* Thrombocytopaenia  
	Mild may be seen in type 2B.
* Coags
	* Prolonged APTT  
	Abnormality depends on degree of factor VIII deficiency.
* Specialised testing  
Specified tests exist to evaluate presence of vWF antigen, factor VIII activity, and classify subtypes.


##Management
Serious bleeding is treated by replenishing vWF and factor VIII levels:
* DDAVP
	* Causes release of vWF from endothelial storage sites
* vWF concentrates
* IVIG  
May be effective if due to anti-vWF autoantibodies, particularly if immune-aquired disease.
* TXA  
Effective independent of aetiology of defect.
