#Hypertensive Dieases of Pregnancy

Hypertension in pregnancy is:
* Defined as sitting:
	* SBP > 140mmHg
	* DBP > 90mmHg
* Common
* Associated with increased maternal, foetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality
* Associated with additional complications
* Classified into four sub-groups:
	* **Preeclampsia/Eclampsia**
		* Preeclampsia is:
			* Generally a high-cardiac output state, associated with inappopriately high SVR
			* Defined as **hypertension** and **proteinuria** after the **20<sup>th</sup> week** of gestation  
			Preeclampsia is defined as severe with *any* of the following features:
				* SBP > 160mmHg
				* DBP > 90mmHg
				* Proteinuria > 5g/24 hours
				* Oliguria  
				< 500ml/24 hours.
				* Cerebral/visual disturbances
				* Seizures
				* Epigastric pain
				* Pulmonary oedema
				* HELLP  
				Haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopaenia.
		* Eclampsia is defined as **preeclampsia** with **seizures**
			* Occurs in ~0.05% of pregnancies
			* Risk continues up to 1 week following delivery  
			30% of seizures are post-partum.
	* **Chronic hypertension**
	* **Chronic hypertension with super-imposed preclampsia/eclampsia**
	* **Gestational hypertension**


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Risk factor sinclude:
* Patient factors
	* Age > 35
	* Pre-existing HTN
	* CKD
	* DM
* Pregnancy factors
	* Nulliparity
	* Multiple gestation

##Pathophysiology
Underlying processes driving placental insufficiency include:
* Maternal endothelial dysfunction
	* Altered endothelial function
		* Increased endothelil secretion
		* Decreased nitric oxide
	* Normal development of a high-flow, low-resistance placental circulation does not occur
* Acute atherlosclerosis and thrombosis of placental vessels  
Results in decreased placental flow and structural blood vessel damage.

These processes:
* Lead to the triad of:
	* **Vasoconstriction**  
	* **Platelet** activation and **aggregation**
	* **Loss** of **circulating volume**
* Result in other end-organ dysfunction
	* Laryngeal oedema
	* Cardiac
		* High cardiac output state with inappropriate SVR
		* Decreased venous capacitance  
		Subsequently, generally normal filling pressures.
		Risk of acute LV failure if diastolic dysfunction present, especially if given volume.
	* Retinal vasospasm
	* Cerebral
		* Oedema
		* Haemorrhage
	* Renal
		* Oliguria
		* Uraemia
	* Hepatic
		* Synthetic coagulopathy
	* Haematological
		* Consumptive coagulopathy

###Hypertension of Pregnancy

###Preeclampsia
Key therapy is **magnesium**. Magnesium has:
* Multifactorial mechanism of action
	* Increased prostacyclin syntehsis
	* Decreases calcium influx  
	Thereby decreasing ATP-consuming Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes.
	* NMDA antagnoism

###Eclampsia
* A
	* Airway protection  
	Prevention of aspiration.
* C
* D
	* Anticonvulsant  
		* Magnesium Sulfate

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* A
	* Laryngeal oedema
		* Note presence of stridor pre-induction
		* Use a smaller ETT
* C
	* Hypertension
		* Management is difficult
		* Hypertension with light GA/laryngoscopy may be problematic
		* Key questions:
			* What is the current BP?
			* What is the trend in the BP?
			* What antihypertensive agents is the patient taking?
	* Volume state  
	May have ↓ intravascular volume; **↑ hypotension with neuraxial techniques**.
* D
	* Liklihood of eclampsia  
	Evaluate presence of:
		* Headache
		* Hyperreflexia/clonus
		* Visual symptoms
		* Extreme hypertension
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Epidural
			* Reduces BP, and improves placental perfusion
			* Provides analgesia during labour
			* Slow titration may be **better than spinal** in severe preeclampsia
			* Consider inserting early, prior to thrombocytopenia developing
			* Requires **normal coagulation profile prior**
				* Platelet count > 70,000/ml  
				Institutional policy may differ.
				* Routine APTT/PT is not required unless:
					* Clinical history of bleeding
					* Other clinical condition that may contribute to coagulopathy
		* Spinal
			* Safe alternative
			* May require additional volume to compensate for the low-volume pre-eclamptic state
		* CSE
			* Preferable to spinal if surgery is long
		* GA
			* RSI associated with dangerous hypertension  
			Consider:
				* Labetalol 1mg/kg pre-induction  
				Reduces BP without affecting foetal blood flow.
			* Magnesium increases sensitivity to muscle relaxants
* F
	* Volume state
		* Urine output
		* Thirst
* H
	* Coagulation profile

	
###Ineffective Therapies

##Complications
Complication of severe pre-eclampsia include:
* Airway obstruction  
Vocal cord oedema due to decreased oncotic and increased hydrostatic pressure.
* Pulmonary oedema  
	* *Usually* due to low oncotic pressure or increased capillary permeability
	* Rarely due to diastolic dysfunction
* Cerebral haemorrhage
* Cerebral oedema
* Renal failure
* DIC
* Death
	* 40% due to cerebral oedema/haemorrhage
	* 40% due to pulmonary  
	Usually iatrogenic fluid overload.
