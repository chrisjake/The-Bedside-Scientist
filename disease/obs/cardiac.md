#Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy
*This describes the general management of the pregnant patient with cardiac disease. Management of [peripartum cardiomyopathy](/disease/cvs/peripartum.md) is covered elsewhere.*

Pregnancy is a:
* Significant circulatory burden  
Achieving a term pregnancy demonstrates presence of physiological reserve.
* Time where underlying cardiac disease is diagnosed

##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
###Identification of High Risk Patients
Adverse maternal outcome associated with:
* Previous:
	* Heart failure
	* TIA/CVA
	* Arrythmia
* ≥ NHYA II or cyanosis
* LV obstruction
* LV EF ≤40%
* Mechanical valve
* AR or PR with underlying complex congenital heart disease

Risk calculators include:
* CARPEG
* ZAHARA

###Contraindications to Pregnancy  
Disease of such risk that pregnancy is considered a contraindication include:
* Severe Pulmonary Hypertension  
Mortality up to 50%.
* Severe obstructive cardiac disease
	* HOCM
	* Aortic stenosis
	* Mitral stenosis
	* Pulmonary stenosis
	* Unrepaired coarctation
* NYHA III or IV heart failure
* Marfan's disease with aortic root ≥4cm

##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
##Assessment
Assessment aims are to determine level of function:
* Exercise tolerance
* HR, BP, and SpO<sub>2</sub>
* Medical therapy  
With particular attention to:
	* Amiodarone
	* Warfarin
	* ACE-I/A2RBs

##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
Key investigations include:
* Bloods
	* Haemoglobin
	* Coagulation status
* ECG
* Echocardiogram
* Cardiac MRI

##Management
Principles of management:
* Optimise cardiac disease
* Aim for a "stress free" labour  
Vaginal delivery preferred.
	* Early epidural is recommended  
	Beware the fixed cardiac-output state.


###Anaesthetic Considerations
* C
	* Nature of lesion
		* Shunts  
		Required SpO<sub>2</sub> and ETCO<sub>2</sub>.
		* Air embolisation
	* Vascular access
	* **Circulation goals**
		* Enhance pulmonary flow
		* Optimise CO
		* Optimise oxygenation
* D
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Regional
			* Advantages
				* Partner in room
				* Avoids risks of GA
				* Allows slow titration of anaesthetic  
				CSE or epidural.
				* Better post-operative analgesia
				* Reduced blood loss
				* Reduced PONV
			* Disadvantages
				* Anticoagulation
				* Maternal anxiety  
				Subsequent CVS effects.
				* Complications of regional
				* Cannot give 100% oxygen
		* General
			* Advantages
				* Anticoagulation status not relevant
				* Reduced maternal anxiety
				* Easier invasive vascular access
				* Facilitate DCR
			* Disadvantages
				* Airway and ventilation risks
				* Haemodynamic perturbance  
				Especially at intubation and extubation.
				* Effect of anaesthetic agents
					* Negative inotropy
					* Cardiac conduction abnormalities
					* Reduced SVR
					* Tocolysis
				* Risk of awareness
				* Greater blood loss
				* Poorer post-operative analgesia, PONV
* I
	* Endocarditis prophylaxis  
	Required in the setting of:
		* Unrepaired cyanotic CHD
		* Repaired CHD with prosthesis  
		In first 6 months.
		* Repaired CHD with residual defects	

###Ineffective Therapies
##Complications
Consequences of cardiac disease in pregancy include:
* Maternal
	* Arrhythmias
	* Heart failure
	* Embolism  
	* CVA
	* Death
* Foetal
	* SGA
	* Prematurity
	* Death
