#Premature Labor

A term gestation is **37-42** weeks. Premature:
* Labor occurs prior to 37 weeks gestation
* Birth occurs in ~10% of deliveries  
Associated with 85% of all perinatal morbidity and mortality, due to:
	* Respiratory distress syndrome
	* Intracranial haemorrhage
	* Ischaemic cerebral damage  
	Intrapartum:
		* Hypoxia
		* Asphyxia
		* Hypotension
	* Hypoglycaemia
	*

##Management
**Tocolytics** are used to stop premature contractions. Agents include:
* Magnesium sulfate
* Calcium channel blockers
* Methylxanthines
* Prostaglandin inhibitors
* Î²-agonists
	* Evaluate for hyperkalemia if on treatment longer than 24 hours
* Ethanol
	* Historical
	* Inhibits ADH, oxytocin, and myometrial contractility

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* D
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Epidural
			* Reduces effects of systemic drugs on foetus
			* Improved foetal perfusion
			* May reduce incidence of ICH by allowing controlled delivery
