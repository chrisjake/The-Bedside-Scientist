#Antepartum Haemorrhage

PV bleeding occurring prior to delivery, and is **major cause** of maternal mortality. Usually due to:
* Placenta previa  
* Abruptio placentae


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Placenta Previa:
* Usually ~1% of total pregnancies
* Risk factors:
	* Prior:
		* Placenta previa
		* LUSCS
		* Myomectomy
		* Endometrial trauma
	* Age
		* < 20 or > 35
	* Smoking
	* Previous caesarian


##Pathophysiology
###Placenta Previa
Implantation of the placenta around the internal os of the cervix. Placenta previa is:
* *Painless*, fresh vaginal bleeding
* Classified into three types
	* Complete (37%)  
	Complete coverage of intenal os.
	* Partial (27%)  
	Partial coverage of the internal os.
	* Marginal (37%)  
	Placenta encroaches on internal os.
* Foetal distress and coagulpathy are rare

###Abruptio Placentae
Premature separation of placenta from the decidua basalis. Placental abruption is:
* Painful
* Generally older vaginal bleeding  
**Blood loss may be concealed**.
* Associated with foetal distress  
* Classified by:
	* Degree of blood loss:
		* Mild
		* Moderate
		* Severe
	* Placetal location:
		* Concealed haemorrhage  
		Bleeding trapped in uterus by placenta.
		* External haemorrhage  
		Blood flowing out of cervix.
		* External haemorrhage iwth placental prolapse

##Clinical Features
###History
###Examination
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
Key consideration is whether there is **active bleeding**. If yes:
* Prepare for emergency LUSCS
	* Often under GA
	* Massive transfusion often required
	* Careful induction of anaesthesia required
* Significant likelihood of post-partum hysterectomy

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* C
	* High likelihood of massive transfusion
	* Invasive arterial monitoring
* D
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Regional  
		Appropriate if **no evidence of hypovolaemia**.
			* Reduced blood loss
			* Reduced aspiration
			* Increased hypotension
			* Technical difficulty
		* General
			* Haemodynamic stability
			* Difficult airway and aspiration risk
* H
	* DIC  
	May develop following profound haemorrhage.
