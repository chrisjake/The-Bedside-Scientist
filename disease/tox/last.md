#Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity

> This is an <span style="color:red">**anaesthetic crisis**</span>  
> Priority is to:
>* **Maintain oxygenation**
>* **Control seizures**
>* **Manage arrythmias or CVS arrest**
>* **Give intravenous lipid emulsion**


Excessive systemic levels of local anaesthetic. LAST presents:
* With CNS or CVS signs  
Up to and including seizures and **cardiac arrest**.
* Variably  
Presentation may be:
	* In PACU, the ward, or after hospital discharge
	* Obscured by other perioperative events

##<span style="color:red">Emergency Management</span>
Immediately:
1. Cease LA injection
2. Call for help
3. Maintain oxygenation and ventilation  
Consider intubation.
4. Ensure secure IV access


5. Control seizures  
**Avoid** propofol due to CVS instability.
6. Control arrhythmia
	* Start ALS if required  
	Consider ECMO.
	* **Avoid**:
		* Vasopressin
		* Calcium-channel blockers
		* Î²-blockade
7. Give **intravenous lipid emulsion**
	* 1.5ml/kg bolus  
	May be repeated.
	* Commence infusion at 0.25ml/kg/min  
	Can double rate if ongoing hypotension.





##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
LAST:
* Occurs in ~1/1,000-1/10,000 regional techniques
	* Cardiac arrest in ~1/25,000
* Associated with:
	* Upper limb and PVB blockade
	* Increased LA dose
	* Reduced patient body weight
	* Use of lignocaine
* Protective factors
	* Use of ultrasound

##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
###Preventative Management
* Use the lowest effective dose of LA required
* Use ultrasound
* Monitor LA spread during injection
	* If not seen, suggests intravascular injection
* Consider use of adrenaline in the block  
Gives a marker for inadvertent intravascular injection.
