#Damage Control Surgery and Resuscitation


Damage control surgery describes correcting or **temporising immediately life-threatening injuries until** a patient **regains** the **physiological reserve** to **tolerate** definitive **repair**. Effect damage control surgery requires:
* Early patient selection
* Abbreviated life-saving surgery
	* Normalise physiology at the expensive of anatomy
	* May result in early amputation of abbreviated surgery leading to neurovascular deficit, in order to save life


Damage control surgery can be divided into **five phases**:
* Presurgery damage control
* Damage control surgery
* ICU resuscitation
* Definitive repair
* Reconstructive surgery




* Control of bleeding
* Correction of hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis
* Prior to definitive surgery
