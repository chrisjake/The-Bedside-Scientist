#Damage Control Surgery + Other Trauma Stuff that Needs to Be Categorised

Damage control surgery is the:
* Control of bleeding
* Correction of hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis
* Prior to definitive surgery


This requires:
* Early patient selection
* Abbreviated life-saving surgery
	* Normalise physiology at the expensive of anatomy
	* May result in early amputation of abbreviated surgery leading to neurovascular deficit, in order to save life


##End-Points of Resuscitation
Values indicating critical physiological derangement include:
* Temperature <35
* pH >7.2
* Ionised Calcium <1
* Plt >50
* INR >1.5
* APTT
* Fibrinogen level <1


##Permissive Hypotension
Titrating blood pressure to:
* Prevent excessive blood loss
* Maintain organ perfusion


Goals:
* Penetrating trauma
	* Maintain cerebration
	* Central pulses
	* SBP >60mmHg
* Blunt trauma
	* Maintain radial pulse
	* SBP >80mmHg
* Head injury
	* Maintain temporal pulse
	* SBP >100mmHg
* Spinal cord injury
	* Avoid SBP â©½90mmHg
	* Aim MAP 85-90mmHg



##Blood Resuscitation
Paeds: 10ml/kg of all blood product is a good guide
