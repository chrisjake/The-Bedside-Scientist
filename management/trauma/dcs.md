#Damage Control Surgery + Other Trauma Stuff that Needs to Be Categorised

Damage control surgery is the:
* Control of bleeding
* Correction of hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis
* Prior to definitive surgery


This requires:
* Early patient selection
* Abbreviated life-saving surgery
	* Normalise physiology at the expensive of anatomy
	* May result in early amputation of abbreviated surgery leading to neurovascular deficit, in order to save life



##Midface Fractures
* Airway control important
* Blood major issue
* Laryngoscopy usually straightforward
* Then realign face
* Usually interventional radiology in first instance
* Bite blocks and splints
* Then surgery in a few days when swelling has improved


##Impact Brain Apnoea

##Cryoprecipitate & Transfusion
* 10-250mg fibrinogen in each bag  
Median 150mg.
* Give calcium every second unit of blood

##PRBC
Physiology:
* pH 6.5
* K ⩾25mmol/L


##TEG/ROTEM
* Point of care viscoelastic test for measurement of coagulation function

##Cyclical Hyper-resuscitation


##Visceral Organ Injury
* Bradycardia/lack of tachycardiac due to vagal stimulation despite inadequate organ confusion


##End-Points of Resuscitation
Values indicating critical physiological derangement include:
* Temperature ⩽35
* pH ⩾7.2
* Ionised Calcium ⩽1
* Plt ⩾50
* INR ⩾1.5
* APTT
* Fibrinogen level ⩽1


##DCS Goals
* Open abdomen
* 4 quadrant packing


##Permissive Hypotension
Titrating blood pressure to:
* Prevent excessive blood loss
* Maintain organ perfusion


Goals:
* Penetrating trauma
	* Maintain cerebration
	* Central pulses
	* SBP >60mmHg
* Blunt trauma
	* Maintain radial pulse
	* SBP >80mmHg
* Head injury
	* Maintain temporal pulse
	* SBP >100mmHg
* Spinal cord injury
	* Avoid SBP ⩽90mmHg
	* Aim MAP 85-90mmHg



##Blood Resuscitation
Paeds: 10ml/kg of all blood product is a good guide
