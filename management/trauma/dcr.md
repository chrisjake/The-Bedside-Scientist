#Damage Control Resuscitation

Philosophy of resuscitation designed to work synergistically with [damage control surgery](/management/trauma/dcs.md), and aims to reduce mortality and haemorrhage by:
* Controlling haemorrhage
* Correcting of hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis
* Avoiding tissue hypoxia and oxygen debt


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors



##Principles of Damage Control Resuscitation
Key principles:
* Reduce blood loss
	* Aggressive control of external haemorrhage
	* Permissive hypotension
* Aggressive transfusion  
See [massive transfusion](/management/haeme/massive-transfusion.md).
* Prevent coagulopathy  
	* Avoid acidosis
	* Avoid hypothermia
	* Transfusion  
	* TXA use  
	1g over 10 minutes, and a further 1g at 8 hours.
	* Minimise crystalloid use
* Maintain DO<sub>2</sub>
	* Transfusion
* Expediting transfer to definitive care



###Permissive Hypotension
Titrating blood pressure to:
* Prevent excessive blood loss prior to definitive surgery
* Maintain organ perfusion


Goals:
* Penetrating trauma
	* Maintain cerebration
	* Central pulses
	* SBP >60mmHg
* Blunt trauma
	* Maintain radial pulse
	* SBP >80mmHg
* Head injury
	* Maintain temporal pulse
	* SBP >100mmHg
* Spinal cord injury
	* Avoid SBP â©½90mmHg
	* Aim MAP 85-90mmHg
