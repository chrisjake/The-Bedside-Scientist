#Neonatal Resuscitation

This section covers resuscitation of the neonate. Neonatal resuscitation is:
* Required in ~5% 
The majority need gentle manoeuvres; drying, stimulation, warming. Need for:
	* Intubation and ventilation is unlikely
	* Compressions is rare  
	Those who require compressions generally do badly.
* Required more commonly in premature infants  
Poor alveolar expansion and reduced surfactant impair transition to adult circulation.


##Assessment
Should cover:
* A
	* Patency  
	Crying indicates patency.
	* Presence of blood/meconium  
	Suction if present.
* B
	* Colour  
		* Normal to remain "hypoxic" for first 10 minutes of life  
		Bluish hands and feet are normal.
* C
	* HR > 130
* E
	* Spontaneous flexion and movements are sign of good tone  
	Suggest unlikely to be compromised.
	* Heat loss prevention is essential


##Management
Follows an ABC approach:
* A
	* Place supine
	* **Dry and stimulate**
	* Head neutral/slightly extended
	* Intubation can be considered if:
		* Unable to BMV
		* No detectable heart rate
* B
	* Commence **PPV with room air** if HR < 100 after drying and stimulation  
	Generally Pip 30, PEEP 5, at a rate of 40-60/minute.
	* Transition to **100% oxygen if**:
		* SpO<sub>2</sub> is < 70% **at 5 minutes**
		* HR < 100/min after 1 minute of PPV
		* Preparing for intubation
		* HR < 60/min and chest compressions indicated
* C
	* Commence chest compressions if:  
	Need for chest compressions mostly occurs if PPV has not been performed correctly.
		* HR < 60/min despite adequate PPV with supplementary oxygen
	* Adrenaline 10-30Âµg/kg (0.1-0.3ml/kg of 1:10,000 solution) if HR < 60
	* Consider 10ml/kg IV crystalloid if blood loss suspected
* E
	* Warm
		* Radiant warmer
		* Polyethylene bag if < 1500g
