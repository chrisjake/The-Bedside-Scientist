#Anterior Mediastinal Mass

> * Anterior mediastinal masses may compress the airway and great vessels under GA, and can be fatal
> * Symptomatic patients are at particularly high risk
> * Children may have severe complications despite absence of or minimal symptoms


Mediastinal masses:
* May occur in the anterior, posterior, middle, or superior mediastinum  
Anterior masses are most likely to cause severe cardiorespiratory problems due to:
	* Proximity to vascular/airway structures
	* Exacerbation of compression in the supine position
* May cause compression of:
	* Tracheobronchial tree
	* Main PA
	* SVC


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
##Pathophysiology
###Aetiology
##Assessment
> * Presence of symptoms indicates elevated risk

Symptoms may be due to:
* Airway compression
	* Dyspnoea
	* Stridor
	* Wheeze
	* Decreased breath sounds
* SVC syndrome
	* Dyspnoea
	* Headache
	* Visual disturbance
	* Altered mentation
	* Distended neck veins

##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
Imaging:
* CT chest  
Most useful scan to evaluate size, location, and severity of compression.

Other:
* Flow-volume loops  
May demonstrate intrathoracic obstruction, but are unreliable as a diagnostic test.

##Management
Surgical:
* Diagnostic
* Therapeutic

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* Team
	* Surgeon available  
		* With rigid bronchoscope
		* To perform emergent sternotomy and relieve compression of mass.
* A
	* Airway plan and induction
		* Awake fibreoptic
			* Safest
			* Allows assessment of site and degree of airway compression
			* Permits intubation distal to site of obstruction
		* Inhalational induction
			* May precipitate airway obstruction
			* Difficult to abandon
			* Partial obstruction may lead to very negative intrathoracic pressures
		* Standard IV induction
	* Airway device(s)  
	**Aim to intubate distal to obstruction**, which may be endobronchial.
		* Long ETT
		* MLT
		* Jet ventilation
		* LMA  
		Permit spontaneous ventilation and bronchoscopy.
	* Consideration of **awake bypass**  
		* Unlikely to succeed as a rescue technique; should be established semi-electively
		* Consider when ventilation is unlikely to be successful post-induction, i.e. compression of:
			* Distal 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of trachea
			* Mainstem bronchi
			* Carina
* B
	* Ventilation strategy
		* **Maintenance of spontaneous ventilation**  
		Desirable to minimise adverse cardiac effects.
		* Positive pressure ventilation  
		Ideally commenced gradually, with progressive taking-over of spontaneous ventilation.
	* Reduced lung volume
	* Bronchial muscle relaxation  
	Occurs under GA, and increases airway compressibility.
* C
	* Invasive pressure monitoring
	* **Mediastinal mass**  
	Evaluate:
		* Size
		* Location  
		Relation to vascular tree/airway.
		* Compression
	* SVC obstruction  
		* Increased venous pressures and bleeding
		* IV access preferentially in lower limbs
* D
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* Local anaesthesia preferred
* E
	* **Positioning**
		* Induction may have to occur in semi-erect or sitting position
		* Post-induction position may need to be changed; consider:
			* Prone
			* Lateral
			* Semi-erect
	* Avoid muscle relaxation  
	To maintain spontaneous ventilation.
