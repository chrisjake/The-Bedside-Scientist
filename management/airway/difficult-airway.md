#Unexpected Difficult Airway

> * All airway techniques fail
> * Repeated attempts at tracheal intubation increases risk of CICO, death, and brain damage
> * Most airway complications are unexpected
> * CICO events are rare but result in high anaesthetic mortality
> * CICO mortality and morbidity occurs due to **delay** in performing FONA, not due to the procedure
> * A standardised approach improves crisis performance
> * Cognitive and motor skills are significantly impaired in a crisis

*This section is taken from the [DAS 2015 guidelines](https://academic.oup.com/bja/article/115/6/827/241440/Difficult-Airway-Society-2015-guidelines-for#2825767).*


* **Plan A**  
Mask ventilation and intubation.
	* Optimise as many factors as possible prior to induction
* **Plan B**  
**Maintain oxygenation** with SAD.
	* Use 2<sup>nd</sup> generation device  
	Higher sealing pressures, gastric port.
	* Up to 3 attempts with different devices/sizes
	* If successful, consider:
		* **Waking**
		* Intubate through SAD  
		Using fibreoptic and aintree catheter.
		* Continue with SAD
		* FONA
	* A failure of two techniques (e.g. intubation and SAD) should prompt preparation for FONA
* **Plan C**  
**Maintain oxgenation** with **face-mask ventilation** (if possible).
	* 2-person technique
	* Use adjuncts (OPA, NPA)
	* Consider fully paralysing the patient if face-mask ventilation is not possible and critical hypoxia is not reached
	* If successful:
		* Wake if able
		* FONA if definitive airway required immediately
* **Plan D**  
**Declare that "This is a [CICO situation](management/airway/cico.md)". Proceed to emergency FONA**.
	* Scalpel cricothyrotomy
	* Needle cricothryotomy
		* Jet ventilation


##The Vortex Approach
*This section describes a complemenatry tool to use when managing the unanticipated difficult airway*


The vortex approach recognises the fact that:
* CICO scenarios are a high-stress event that causes cognitive overload  
Cognitive biases abound, with impaired decision-making, fixation, omissions being common.
	* Complicated guidelines are hard to follow in such situations
* Surgical airway techniques are psychlogically confronting
* Existing guidelines focus on clinical content rather than human factors

Principles of the vortex approach:
* There are three 'non-surgical' airway management options  
Though there are many different airway management techniques, most are not applicable in the unexpected airway emergency. Reducing the number of emergency tools encourages clinicians to become proficient with a limited number of devices.
	* BMV
	* SGA
	* ETT
* If a 'best effort' at any of these three lifelines is unsuccessful, another should be attempted  
'Best effort' and 'reasonable number of attempts' are a context-dependent decision.
	* A failure of any technique is a 'spinal inwards' towards the centre  
	Emphasises:
		* Diminishing time and options available as successive techniques fail
		* If oxygenation cannot be achieved with a non-surgical technique, FONA must be performed
	* Ability to oxygenate/ventilate results in movement outwards towards the 'green zone'  
	This **position of relative safety** should prompt:
		* Reoxygenation  
		Optimise SpO<sub>2</sub> and re-establish FRC.
		* Assembling additional resources
			* Personnel
			* Equipment
			* Location
		* Make a plan:
			* **Maintain the current lifeline**
			* **Convert the lifeline to a preferred technique**
				* Perform a semi-elective tracheostomy
				* Convert an LMA to an ETT via use of an Aintree catheter
			* Optimise the current technique to re-attempt the primary technique
