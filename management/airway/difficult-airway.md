#Unexpected Difficult Airway

> * All airway techniques fail
> * Repeated attempts at tracheal intubation increases risk of CICO, death, and brain damage
> * Most airway complications are unexpected
> * CICO events are rare but result in high anaesthetic mortality
> * CICO mortality and morbidity occurs due to **delay** in performing FONA, not due to the procedure
> * A standardised approach improves crisis performance
> * Cognitive and motor skills are significantly impaired in a crisis

##Epidemiology
* The most common cause of airway related death is hypoxia
	* Aspiration is the most common cause of airway related anaesthetic death
* Complications from airway management are more common in ED and ICU


* Failed tracheal intubation occurs in:
	* ~1/1000-2000 elective cases 
	* ~1/250 obstetric RSI
	* ~1/100 ED intubations
* Failed or difficult tracheal intubation was the primary event in >1/3<sup>rd</sup> of events


* CICO occurs in ~1/50,000 elective anaesthetics
	* CICO is low compared to incidence of difficult intubation
* CICO contributes 25% of anaesthesia-related mortality
* Requirement for emergency FONA increases morbidity 15x  
	* ~25% permanent harm or death
* In 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of CICO situations, a surgical airway was performed too late to prevent harm  

##Factors Contributing to Adverse Airway Events
* Human factors  
Human failures occur in ~80% of airway events.
	* Delayed decision to declare failed airway
	* Delay in decision to perform cricothyrotomy
	* Equipment knowledge
	* Training  
	Especially in surgical airway and rescue techniques.
	* Poor communication
	* Poor teamwork
	* Tunnel vision/task focus
	* Training
	* Systems
* Patient Factors
	* Obesity

##Avoiding the Difficult Airway
Preparation prior to induction reduces incidence of difficult tracheal intubation:
* Adequate **preoxygenation** and denitrogenation  
EtO<sub>2</sub> > 80% indicates a good proportion of FRC is oxygen, significantly prolonging safe apnoea times from 1-2 minutes up to 8 minutes.
	* Note that reduced FRC (e.g. atelectasis) will lead to shunt and rapid drop in SpO<sub>2</sub> despite a high ETO<sub>2</sub> fraction  
	Significant shunt will result in an SpO<sub>2</sub> of < 100% despite adequate ETO<sub>2</sub>.
	* This can only be achieved when breathing oxygen through a closed-circuit system
* **Recruitment**  
Use of CPAP during preoxygenation prolongs safe apnoea time in obese patients.
* **Positioning**  
	* Ensure EAM is level with sternal notch to maximise ease of intubation
	* Ramping increases FRC in the obese patient
* **Apnoeic oxygenation**  
Delivery of oxygen via nasal cannula during the apnoeic period. This:
	* May be performed with:
		* Standard nasal cannula from wall oxygen at 15L.min<sup>-1</sup>
		* Humidified 
	* Requires a patent airway  
	May not help during the apnoeic period when airway tone is reduced.
	* May be useful when:
		* Oxygenation is compromised
		* Laryngoscopy is difficult
* Use **adequate doses of rapid-onset neuromuscular blocking drugs**


Important technical factors include:
* Make the **first attempt** the **best attempt**
	* Subsequent attempts are less successful
	* Efficacy of SAD rescue is reduced with more attempts
* Equipment and technique
	* Selection of laryngoscopes, and experience in their use
	* Bougie  
	Pre-shaped.
	* ELM
	* Remove cricoid pressure if view is poor
* **Call for help early**
* Maximum of **3 attempts** by a single provider

* **Plan A**  
Mask ventilation and intubation.
	* Optimise as many factors as possible prior to induction
* **Plan B**  
**Maintain oxygenation** with SAD.
	* Use 2<sup>nd</sup> generation device  
	Higher sealing pressures, gastric port.
	* Up to 3 attempts with different devices/sizes
	* If successful, consider:
		* **Waking**
		* Intubate through SAD  
		Using fibreoptic and aintree catheter.
		* Continue with SAD
		* FONA
	* A failure of two techniques (e.g. intubation and SAD) should prompt preparation for FONA
* **Plan C**  
**Maintain oxgenation** with **face-mask ventilation** (if possible).
	* 2-person technique
	* Use adjuncts (OPA, NPA)
	* Consider fully paralysing the patient if face-mask ventilation is not possible and critical hypoxia is not reached
	* If successful:
		* Wake if able
		* FONA if definitive airway required immediately
* **Plan D**  
**Declare that "This is a [CICO situation](management/airway/cico.md)". Proceed to emergency FONA**.
	* Scalpel cricothyrotomy
	* Needle cricothryotomy
		* Jet ventilation
