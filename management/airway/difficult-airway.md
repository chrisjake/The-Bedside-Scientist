#Unexpected Difficult Airway

> * CICO events are rare but result in high anaesthetic mortality
> * A standardised approach improves crisis performance
> * Cognitive and motor skills are significantly impaired in a crisis

##Epidemiology
* CICO occurs in ~1/50,000 elective anaesthetics
* CICO contributes 25% of anaesthesia-related mortality

##Factors Contributing to Adverse Airway Events
* Human factors  
Contributory in ~40% of airway events, and important in almost all.
	* Delayed decision to declare failed airway
	* Delay in decision to perform cricothyrotomy
	* Equipment knowledge
	* Training  
	Especially in surgical airway and rescue techniques.
	* Poor communication
	* Poor teamwork
	* Tunnel vision/task focus
	* Training
	* Systems

##Avoiding the Difficult Airway
Preparation prior to induction reduces incidence of difficult tracheal intubation:
* Adequate **preoxygenation** and denitrogenation  
EtO<sub>2</sub> > 80% indicates a good proportion of FRC is oxygen, significantly prolonging safe apnoea times from 1-2 minutes up to 8 minutes.
	* Note that reduced FRC (e.g. atelectasis) will lead to shunt and rapid drop in SpO<sub>2</sub> despite a high ETO<sub>2</sub> fraction  
	Significant shunt will result in an SpO<sub>2</sub> of < 100% despite adequate ETO<sub>2</sub>.
	* This can only be achieved when breathing oxygen through a closed-circuit system
* **Recruitment**  
Use of CPAP during preoxygenation prolongs safe apnoea time in obese patients.
* **Positioning**  
	* Ensure EAM is level with sternal notch to maximise ease of intubation
	* Ramping increases FRC in the obese patient
* **Apnoeic oxygenation**  
Delivery of oxygen via nasal cannula during the apnoeic period. This:
	* May be performed with:
		* Standard nasal cannula from wall oxygen at 15L.min<sup>-1</sup>
		* Humidified 
	* Requires a patent airway  
	May not help during the apnoeic period when airway tone is reduced.
	* May be useful when:
		* Oxygenation is compromised
		* Laryngoscopy is difficult
* Use **adequate doses of rapid-onset neuromuscular blocking drugs**


Important technical factors include:
* Make the **first attempt** the **best attempt**
	* Subsequent attempts are less successful
	* Efficacy of SAD rescue is reduced with more attempts
* Equipment and technique
	* Selection of laryngoscopes, and experience in their use
	* Bougie  
	Pre-shaped.
	* ELM
	* Remove cricoid pressure if view is poor
* **Call for help early**
* Maximum of **3 attempts** by a single provider

* **Plan A**  
Mask ventilation and intubation.
	* Optimise as many factors as possible prior to induction
* **Plan B**  
**Maintain oxygenation** with SAD.
	* Use 2<sup>nd</sup> generation device  
	Higher sealing pressures, gastric port.
	* Up to 3 attempts with different devices/sizes
	* If successful, consider:
		* **Waking**
		* Intubate through SAD  
		Using fibreoptic and aintree catheter.
		* Continue with SAD
		* FONA
* **Plan C**  
**Maintain oxgenation** with **face-mask ventilation** (if possible).
	* 2-person technique
	* Use adjuncts (OPA, NPA)
	* Consider fully paralysing the patient if face-mask ventilation is not possible and critical hypoxia is not reached
	* If successful:
		* Wake if able
		* FONA if definitive airway required immediately
* **Plan D**  
**Emergency FONA**.
	* Scalpel cricothyrotomy
	* Needle cricothryotomy
		* Jet ventilation

###Front of Neck Access
Cricothyrotomy techniques include:
* Scalpel cricothyrotomy
	* Faster than needle cricothyrotomy
	* More reliable than needle cricothyrotomy
	* Should be performed with neuromuscular blockade
	* Many techniques  
	No evidence any one technique is superior.
* Needle cricothyrotomy
	* May be favoured by anaesthetists who are more comfortable with needles than scalpels
	* Use of a 14G cannula facilitates jet ventilation
	* Cannula can be converted to a definitive airway using Seldinger technique
