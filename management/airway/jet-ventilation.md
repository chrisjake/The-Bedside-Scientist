#Transtracheal Jet Ventilation

*Insertion technique is covered under [needle cricothyrotomy](procedures/needle-cricothyrotomy.md)*

Transtracheal jet ventilation is the delivery of oxygen via a cannula 

##Indications
* Rescue technique in CICO situation
* Anticipated difficult airway
* Laryngeal and oral surgery

##Contraindications

##Ventilation Technique
Jet ventilation:
* Provides oxygen via the tracheal route
* Exhalation occurs via the normal oral route
	* Airway obstruction may lead to high airway pressures and pneumothorax
	* Adequate expiratory time must be given
* Can be either:
	* Hand ventilation
	* High-frequency jet ventilation

##Complications
* Overall complication rate ~1% in centres with >100 cases/year
* Higher risk than supraglottic or subglottic jet-ventilation

* Pressure related:
	* Pneumothorax
	* Pneumoediastinum
	* Subcutaneous emphysema
	May be significant or minor.
		* May occur due to:
			* Catheter dislodgement
			* Use of high airway pressures
	* Cardiovascular instability  
	Impaired RV function due to decreased preload/increased afterload.
* Kinking of catheter
* Bleeding
* Infection
