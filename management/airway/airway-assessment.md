#Airway Assessment

> * Airway assessment should always be performed
> * Predicting an anatomically difficult airway is unreliable
> 	* When a predicted difficult airway exists, a plan should be developed to manage that particular difficulty
> * Previous difficulty with a technique is the greatest predictor of difficulty with that technique

Airway assessment involves examining potential:
* Anatomical difficulty  
* Physiological difficulty
* Situational difficulty

##Anatomical Difficulty
Anatomical difficulty can be divided into difficulty with:
* Mask Ventilation
* SAD placement
* Intubation
* FOI
* FONA

Difficulty with one technique is associated with difficulty of other techniques.
* Consider **elective cannulation of the CTM** if multiple anatomical difficulties exist


###Difficult Mask Ventilation
Inability to keep ventilate without:
* 2-person technique
* Adjuncts
* Paralysis

Assessment:
* Typically poorly predicted  
In one study, only 17% of difficulty was predicted.
* Risk increases with >1 risk factor

Risk Factors:
* Male
* Mallampati III/IV
* Snoring
* Teeth (lack of)
* Age >55
* Beard
* BMI >25


###Difficult Intubation
* Cormack and Lehane Grading:  
Cook modification correlates better with time to intubate and requirement for adjuncts:
	* 

###Difficult SAD Placement
Defined as inability to ventilate, requiring removal and tracheal intubaiton.

SAD failure occurs in ~1% of instances, and is usually due to:
* Leak
* Obstruction

Risk Factors:
* Male
* Obesity
* Rotation  
Non-level operating table.
* Teeth (poor)

###Difficult FOI

Epidemiology:
* FOI failure occurs in ~1.5% of instances. 
* Epistaxis occurs in ~10%
	* Severe epistaxis occurs in ~1.3%


###Difficult FONA


##Physiological Difficulty


##Situational Difficulty
