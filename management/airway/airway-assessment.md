#Airway Assessment

> * Airway assessment should always be performed
> * Predicting difficult airway is not always reliable
> 	* When a predicted difficult airway exists, a plan should be developed to manage that particular difficulty


Airway assessment involves examining potential:
* Anatomical difficulty  
Including the difficulty of:
	* Face mask ventilation
	* LMA placement
	* ETT placement
	* Surgical airway
* Physiological difficulty
* Situational difficulty

##Anatomical Difficulty

* Consider **elective cannulation of the CTM**
* **Ventilation**  
Exhalation occurs via the normal oral route, and so adequate time for exhalation must be provided.
	* Hand ventilation
	* High-frequency jet ventilation
