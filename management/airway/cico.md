#Can't Intubate, Can't Oxygenate
* This covers the CICO situation from the [difficult airway drill](management/airway/difficult-airway.md#drill).

> * CICO should be **verbally declared**
> * A CICO situation may occur when oxygen saturations are normal


A CICO situation occurs when there is a failure (or impending failure) to deliver oxygen due to supraglottic obstruction, and:
* This obstruction is unlikely to be relieved by persistent attempts at supraglottic rescue
* This obstruction may be bypassed with front of neck access
* Failure is defined as:
	* ETT  
	Three optimal attempts.
	* SAD  
	Two attempts with different sizes or devices.
	* Bag-Mask Ventilation with use of adjuncts


###Front of Neck Access
Cricothyrotomy techniques include:
* Scalpel cricothyrotomy
	* Faster than needle cricothyrotomy
	* More reliable than needle cricothyrotomy
	* Should be performed with neuromuscular blockade
	* Many techniques  
	No evidence any one technique is superior.
* Needle cricothyrotomy
	* May be favoured by anaesthetists who are more comfortable with needles than scalpels
	* Use of a 14G cannula facilitates jet ventilation
	* Cannula can be converted to a definitive airway using Seldinger technique
