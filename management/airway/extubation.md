#Extubation

> * In all peri-extubation airway problems, rapid supplemental oxygen administration is beneficial


Emergence is associated with more airway problems than induction.

##Planning Extubation
Assessing for extubation requires:
* A
	* Can the patient maintain their own airway?
	* What is the risk of aspiration?  
	Baseline risk of aspiration in the anaesthetic population is 2-10/10,000.
* B
	* Is there adequate oxygenation?
		* FiO<sub>2</sub>
		* PEEP requirement
	* Is there adequate ventilation?
		* ETCO<sub>2</sub>
		* Pressure Support requirement
* C
	* Is there any CVS compromise?
* D
	* Is there adequate analgesia?


##Performing Extubation
* Consider placing a bite block  
Especially in young, male patients.
	* Prevents tube lumen occlusion if the tube is bitten
	* If the tube is bitten, then deflate the pilot balloon to allow the patient to breath around the ETT, minimising the risk of negative-pressure pulmonary oedema
* Position the patient appropriately
	* Left lateral with the head below the level of the heart if high aspiration risk
	* Sit up supine to optimise FRC if low aspiration risk/risk of desaturation
* Suction the airway
* Provide 100% oxygen
* Extubate at end-inspiration  
Vocal cords are maximally abducted at this point.
* Provide positive airway pressure during extubation, prior to removing the tube from the glottis  
Increases airway pressure in the trachea, assisting expulsion of secretions from the vocal cords as the tube is removed.

###Strategies for Difficult Extubation
* LMA exchange  
Place an LMA during a deep plane of anaesthesia and allow emergence to occur with the LMA in situ.
* Place a tube exchange wire  
	* Used when reintubation may be difficult
	* A wire is left in situ in the trachea, and secured to the patient
	* The wire is reasonably well tolerated, and can be left up to 72 hours


##Problems Occurring During Extubation
Problems include:
* A
	* **Obstruction**
		* Laryngospasm  
		Most common cause of post-extubation upper airway obstruction.
		* Oedema  
		Particularly in:
			* Children
			* Prolonged period of intubation
			* Prone
			* Larger ETT to tracheal size
		* Trauma
		* Vocal Cord Dysfunction  
		Paradoxical movement of the vocal cords, which may present as stridor or complete upper airway obstruction.
			* Diagnosed by  visualisation of paradoxical adduction of vocal cords in inspiration
			* More common in:
				* Young
				* Female
				* Upper respiratory tract infections
				* Stress
		* Vocal Cords Paralysis
			* Due to vagal nerve injury
	* ETT damage
		* Damaged pilot tube preventing deflation
	* Laryngeal trauma/oedemma
	* Cuff herniation
	* Surgical fixation  
	Of airway device to surrounding structures
* B
	* Coughing  
	May be reduced by placing lignocaine or lignocaine/sodium bicarbonate solution into the ETT cuff, or marinating the ETT cuff in lignocaine prior to intubation.
	* Bronchospasm
	* Negative pulmonary oedema  
	Pulmonary oedema due to extreme negative intra-alveolar pressure, in turn due to high inspiratory effort against a narrow or closed upper airway (e.g. occluded ETT).
* C
	* CVS instability  
	Generally ↑ MAP and HR, with corresponding ↓ in EF due to a reduction in afterload.
