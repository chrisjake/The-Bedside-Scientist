#Intrauterine Resuscitation

> General principle is to optimise foetal DO<sub>2</sub> by:
> * Improving uterine perfusion pressure
>	* Increasing systemic driving pressure
>	* Reducing intrauterine pressure
> * Increasing maternal oxygen saturation
> * Removing any cord impingement

Intrauterine resuscitation:
* Describes techniques used to correct **common** and **reversible** causes foetal hypoxia, prior to harm occurring  
Non-correctable (e.g. anencephaly) or rare causes (e.g. ruptured vasa praevia) are not captured.
* Relies on detection of foetal distress by [electronic foetal monitoring]



##Management
Increasing degree of escalation:
* Place in full left (or right) lateral position  
Removes aorto-caval compression.
* Reduce/cease oxytocin infusion  
Reduces intrauterine pressure, reducing foetal compression and improving uteroplacental blood flow.
* Give fluid bolus  
500ml-1L CSL.
	* Associated with improvement in foetal oxygenation even with adequate maternal driving pressure
	* **Caution** in women with **preeclampsia** or receiving tocolytics
* Give vasopressor  
Particularly if foetal distress is **epidural** or **spinal associated**.
	* Phenylephrine 50-100μg
	* Ephedrine
* Give tocolytics
	* 250μg terbutaline SC

###Second-line Strategies
* Administer 15L/min O<sub>2</sub>  
	* Placental transfer of oxygen is driven by tension (mmHg) rather than content (ml/100ml), and so this may be effective even in a normoxic mother
	* Evidence supporting this practice is inconsistent
* Alternate maternal position  
May alleviate cord compression depending on relationship between pelvis, foetus, and cord. Consider:
	* These positions
		* Full left lateral
		* Full right lateral
		* All fours
	* Will probably be unhelpful if **oligohydramnios** or nuchal cord is present
* Amnioinfusion  
Transfusion of normal saline into the uterine cavity where foetal distres is due to cord compression secondary to oligohydramnios.
* Elevation of the foetal vertex  
Transvaginal elevation of the foetal head out of the birth canal for foetal distress due to cord prolapse.
