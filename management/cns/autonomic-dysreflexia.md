#Autonomic Dysreflexia

Potentially **life-threatening sympathetic overactivity** occurring in patients with a **spinal injury above T6**.


Syndrome of excess sympathetic activity in patients with 
	* Occurring when:
		* Spinal injury level is T6 or higher  
		Increasing risk with higher injuries.
		* Stimulus occurs below the leve o fhte injury
	*  
	Associated symptoms include:
		* Bradycardia
		* Flushing/sweating
		* Headache
		* Blurred vision

				* Treat by:
			* Remove stimulus
			* Provide vasodilator
		* Incidence ↓ with use of neuraxial anaesthesia


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
##Pathophysiology
Noxious stimulus below the level of injury:
* Ascending sensory fibres convey message to spinal cord
* Widespread SNS reflex activity occuring below the level of injury  
Sympathetic ganglion activity remains uncontrolled due to lack of descending inhibition.
* Compensatory parasympathetic activity **above** the level of injury
	* ↑ BP detected by baroreceptors  
	Leads to compensatory bradycardia.

###Aetiology
Common causes include:
* Bladder
	* Distension
	* Hyperactivity
	* UTI
	* Stones
	* IDC placement
	* Trans-urethral urological procedures
* Bowel
	* Constipation
	* Gaseous distension
	* Rectal irritation
	* Haemorrhoids
* Skin
	* Burns
	* Pressure areas
	* Tight clothing
* Other
	* Lower limb trauma
	* GU
		* Intercourse
		* Menstrual cramping
		* Labour

##Assessment
Presentation due to SNS overactivity, with compensatory PNS responses:
* B
	* Dyspnoea
* C
	* HTN  
	↑ SBP ⩾20%,
	* Bradycardia
	* Flushing  
	Above level.
* D
	* Blurred vision
	* Headache  
	Due to HTN.
	* Anxiety/irritation
* E
	* Above level
		* Sweating  
	* Below level
		* Palor
		* Piloerection

##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
> * Identify and remove obvious causes
> * Control BP
> * BP may drop precipitously folllowing removal of stimulus.

Sit upright.

Remove obvious causes:
* Ask the patient/carer
* Loosen constrictive clothing
* Check bladder drainage equipment
	* Kinks
	* Clogging
	* Overfull bag
	* Consider irrigating catheter if blocked  
* Consider IDC
* Consider faecal evacuation  
If bladder empty.

Pharmacological therapy:
* If SBP >150mmHg
* Use short acting agents  
Minimises hypotension once stimulus has resolved.
	* GTN 400μg SL
	* Captopril 25mg SL
	* Hydralazine 5mg IV Q10min
	* Labetaolol 5mg iV Q5min
* Analgesia  
If a noxious stimulus present, e.g. trauma.

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* D
	* Anaesthetic technique
		* General  
		Appropriate if there is a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, or muscle spasms.
		* Neuraxial  
		Appropriate if there is a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, or muscle spasms.
			* Spinal anaesthesia effectively prevents autonomic dysreflexia
			* Epidural anaesthesia is less reliable, as a patch block may occur
		* Regional/local  
		Appropriate if:
			* Reduced sensation at site
			* No risk of autonimic dysreflexia
		* Monitored anaesthetic care  
		Appropriate if:
			* No sensation at site
			* No risk of autonomic dysreflexia

##Complications
Include:
* Death
* CVS  
~22%.
	* Myocardial ischaemia
	* APO
* CNS  
~70%; major cause of death.
	* CVA
