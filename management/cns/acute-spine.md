#Acute Spinal Cord Injury

*Covers management of spinal cord injuries in the first few weeks following injury. Management differs in the patient with a [chronic spinal cord injury](/management/cns/chronic-spine.md).*

Acute spinal cord injury occurs commonly, and is frequently devastating. Management involves identifying and treating:
* **Spinal shock**  
Altered physiological state that:
	* Occurs **immediately** after spinal cord injury
	* May **last days to weeks**
	* Involves a loss of function distal to the injury:
		* Flaccid paralysis
		* Hyporeflexia
		* Anaesthesia
		* Incontinence
* **Neurogenic shock**  
	* May occur within 30 minutes
	* May last up to 6 weeks
	Features include:
		* Hypotension  
		Significant orthostatic hypotension.
		* Bradycardia
		* Hypothermia
* **[Autonomic dysreflexia](/management/cns/autonomic-dysreflexia.md)**  


##Epidemiology and Risk Factors
##Pathophysiology
###Neurogenic shock
Spinal cord injury causing sympathectomy, leading to relative parasympathetic overactivity.

##Assessment
##Diagnostic Approach and DDx
##Investigations
##Management
> * Avoid secondary injury by preventing hypoxia and hypotension

* A
	* May have unstable c-spine or require immobilisation
* B
	* Multiple potential respiratory complications  
	Due to poor respiratory muscle function and immobility.
		* Respiratory failure
		* Atelectasis
		* Bronchospasm  
		If sympathectomy above T6.
		* Pneumonia  
		Mucous plugging.
		* PE
* C
	* Maintain spinal cord perfusion  
		* **MAP 85-90mmHg**
		* Avoid SBP < 90.
	* Neurogenic shock  
	Maintenance of blood pressure crucical to prevent ongoing secondary injury.
		* HR  
		Bradycardia may require atropine or pacing.
	* [Autonomic dysreflexia](/management/cns/autonomic-dysreflexia.md)
* E
	* Temperature control  
	Vasodilation and excessive heat loss below the injury.
* F
	* Electrolyte disorders  
		* Hyponatraemia  
		Common, likely due to RAS dysfunction due to reduced renal sympathetic tone.
* G
	* Delayed gastric emptying
	* Constipation
	* Gastric ulceration

###Airway Management
Principles:
* MILS  
Reduces amount of c-spine movement during airway management. MILS:
	* Involves:
		* Stabilisation of the head by an assiant
		* Assistant holds the mastoid processes and occiput steady  
		May be done from from or back.
	* Increases the rate of failed airway maangement
* Use of airway adjuncts  
Use for mask ventilation to reduce:
	* Requirement for c-spine movement
	* Gastric insufflation
* Avoid suxamethonium
* Consider:
	* Videolaryngoscopy  
	At a minimum for all patients with high-thoracic or c-spine injury.
	* FOI  
	Reduces amount of c-spine movement. May be performed awake or asleep.
		* May be difficult due to blood/secretions
		* Awake FOI
			* Coughing and gagging may lead to spine movement  
			May occur either from topicalisation, or if topicalisation inadequate.
			* Requires sedation  
			Limits post-intubation neurological assessment.
		* Asleep FOI
			* R
	* Not using cricoid pressure  
	May worsen injury.

###Anaesthetic Considerations
* A
	* Difficult airway due to immobilisation
* C
	* Arterial line  
	Required if high thoracic injury or above.
	* Vasoactive support
		* Consider vasopressor infusion during induction
* E
	**Suxamethonium** is **contraindicated 48-72 hours post-injury**  
	Fatal hyperkalaemia may result due to up-regulation of ACh receptors.
* G
	* Aspiration risk  
	High risk due to gastric dilation and â†“ emptying.
