#Lung Isolation

Lung isolation and one-lung ventilation:
* Has many uses in thoracic surgery and ICU
* May be difficult to achieve
* May lead to complications and physiological compromise

##Indications
Absolute:
* Protective isolation
	* Massive haemorrhage
	* Pneumonia
* Control of distribution of ventilation
	* Massive bullae
	* Bronchopleural fistula
* Unilateral lung lavage
* VATS

Relative:
* Surgical exposure
	* Thoracic aortic aneurysm
	* Pneumonectomy
	* Upper lobectomy
	* Oesophageal surgery
	* Thoracoscopy

##Contraindications
##Anatomy
##Equipment
Specific equipment for lung isolation include:
* Double-lumen ETT
* Bronchial blocker

###Double-Lumen ETT
DLTs:
* Common and versatile
* Relatively contraindicated in:
	* Poor laryngoscopic airway grades  
	Difficult to insert, and *extremely* challenging to railroad over a bougie or bronchoscope.
	* Aberrant tracheobronchial anatomy  
	Potential for significant iatrogenic injury.
* Come in left- and right-sided variants
	* As the right bronchus intermedius is very short, it is easy to accidentally occlude the right upper lobe with a right-sided DLT  
	The side-port on right-sided ports should generally be positioned under bronchoscopic guidance to minimise this risk.
	* In general, a left sided DLT is used for most cases unless:
		* Surgical resection will involve the proximal left main bronchus
		* Aberrant anatomy precludes use of a left-sided DLT
* Measured in French gauge  
In general; 41-39Fr is appropriate for males, and 37Fr for females.


Pros of DLTs:
* Provide generally good isolation
* Facilitate easy recruitment and de-recruitment of lung


Cons of DLTs:
* Large and harder to insert than standard ETTs  
* Smaller internal lumens than standard ETTs  
Require a bronchoscope with a < 4mm lumen to instrument a 35 Fr DLT.


Types of DLTs:


##Isolation Technique
Isolation can be achieved using:
* Double lumen ETT
* Bronchial blocker
* Endobronchial intubation with a single-lumen ETT


###Isolation with Double-Lumen ETT


###Isolation with Bronchial Blocker
* Ventilate the patient with 100% O<sub>2</sub>  
Aim for maximal denitrogenation.
* Turn PEEP to 0cmH<sub>2</sub>O
* Insert bronchial blocker  
May be inserted under bronchoscopic guidance or directed blindly.
* Inflate the bronchial blocker  
This can be performed:
	* At end-expiration (when lung volume is at its minimum)  
	This will decrease the size of the isolated section of lung and therefore the impediment to the surgeon.
	* After waiting until desaturation begins to occur  
	In a patient who has been ventilated on 100% oxygen, this will indicate maximal atelectasis in the lung (though may take some time to occur).


##Ventilatory Technique
> * Priority is to **avoid hypoxia**  
Typically aim SpO<sub>2</sub> > 90%
> * Maximise PVR in the independent/operative/deflated lung
> * Minimise PVR in the dependent/ventilated lung

General Approach:
* Optimise FRC of the dependent lung  
Occurs at lower than usual volumes due to paralysis, lateral position, and the weight of the mediastinum.
* Begin at:
	* FiO<sub>2</sub> of 1.0 and downtitrate
	* Vt of 8-10ml/kg
		* Vt of <8ml/kg may lead to atelectasis
		* Vt of >15ml/kg can increase PVR in the ventilated lung
	* 5cmH<sub>2</sub> of PEEP
* Targeting:
	* Pplat < 25cmH<sub>2</sub>O
	* PaCO<sub>2</sub> ~35mmHg


###Responding to Hypoxaemia
* Ensure:
	* DLT not obstructed
	* Haemodynamic state acceptable
	* Mediastinal pressure not being performed by surgeon
* Increase FiO<sub>2</sub>
* Increase PEEP  
Typically up to 10cmH<sub>2</sub>O - noting that excessive PEEP will worsen PVR.
* CPAP to operative lung


##Complications
Complications of one-lung ventilation include:
* Hypoxia due to shunt
* Acute Lung Injury  
~2-5% incidence.
