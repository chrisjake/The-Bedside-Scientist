#One-Lung Ventilation

##Indications
Absolute:
* Protective isolation
	* Massive haemorrhage
	* Pneumonia
* Control of distribution of ventilation
	* Massive bullae
	* Bronchopleural fistula
* Unilateral lung lavage
* VATS

Relative:
* Surgical exposure
	* Thoracic aortic aneurysm
	* Pneumonectomy
	* Upper lobectomy
	* Oesophageal surgery
	* Thoracoscopy

##Contraindications
##Anatomy
##Equipment
##Isolation Technique
Isolation can be achieved using:
* Endobronchial intubation with a single-lumen ETT
* Double lumen ETT
* Bronchial blocker


##Ventilatory Technique
> * Priority is to **avoid hypoxia**  
Typically aim SpO<sub>2</sub> > 90%
> * Maximise PVR in the independent/operative/deflated lung
> * Minimise PVR in the dependent/ventilated lung

General Approach:
* Optimise FRC of the dependent lung  
Occurs at lower than usual volumes due to paralysis, lateral position, and the weight of the mediastinum.
* Begin at:
	* FiO<sub>2</sub> of 1.0 and downtitrate
	* Vt of 8-10ml/kg
		* Vt of <8ml/kg may lead to atelectasis
		* Vt of >15ml/kg can increase PVR in the ventilated lung
	* 5cmH<sub>2</sub> of PEEP
* Targeting:
	* Pplat <25cmH<sub>2</sub>O
	* PaCO<sub>2</sub> ~35mmHg


Responding to hypoxaemia:
* Ensure
	* DLT not obstructed
	* Haemodynamic state acceptable
	* Mediastinal pressure not being performed by surgeon
* Increase FiO<sub>2</sub>
* Increase PEEP  
Typically up to 10cmH<sub>2</sub>O - noting that excessive PEEP will worsen PVR.
* CPAP to operative lung
