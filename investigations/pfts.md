#Pulmonary Function Tests

Pulmonary function tests are used to:
* Diagnose disease
* Monitor response to therapy
* Monitor disease progress
* Perioperatively for:
	* Lung resection
	* Other surgery
* Evaluate disability
* Prognosticate


Includes tests of:
* Ventilation
* Gas exchange
* Other

##Testing
May involve testing:
* Ventilation
* Gas exchange
* Other

##Ventilation Tests
Include:
	* Peak flow
	* Spirometry
	* Total body plethysmography

###Peak Flow
Patient forcefully exhales from a vital capacity breath into a peak flow meter:
* Measures peak expiratory flow rate
* Cheap and easy to perform
* Used in monitoring course of obstructive disease  
Asthma and COAD.

###Spirometry
* Patients breaths in and out of a flowmeter
* Allows all volumes *except* residual volume to be measured, i.e.
	* Tidal volume
	* Expiratory reserve volume
	* Inspiratory reserve volume
* From this, capacities calculated include:
	* Vital capacity
	* Inspiratory capacity
* Forced vital capacity can also be measured  
Tests ability of lungs to act as a bellows ,and is reduced by restrictive disease.
	* FEV<sub>1</sub> can be derived  
	Indicates how effectively a patient can cough, and is reduced in obstructive disease.
	* FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio  
	Allows differentiation between obstructive and restrictive disease.
		* Normal is ~80%
* May be performed before-and-after bronchodilator use  
Assesses reversibility of disease.


####Lung Resection
Broadly speaking, resection is appropriate if:
* FEV<sub>1</sub> ⩾1.5L for lobectomy
* FEV<sub>1</sub> ⩾2.0L or 80% predicted for pneumonectomy

Post-operative FEV<sub>1</sub> can be calculated as follows:

$$Post-operative / FEV_1 = Pre-operative / FEV_1 \times {Segments \ left \ after \ resection \over 19}
* Where 19 is the number of existing preoperative bronchopulmonary segments


If the FEV<sub>1</sub> results do not suggest suitability, then consider:
* Quantitative lung scan  
Surgery appropriate if:
	* % ppo FEV<sub>1</sub> ⩾40%
	* % ppo TLCO ⩾40%
* VO<sub>2</sub> max testing  
Surgery appropriate if VO<sub>2</sub> max is ⩾15mL/kg/min.

###Total Body Plethysmography  
Allows measurement of volumes and capacities that are not measured with spirometry, including:
* Residual volume
* Functional residual capacity
* Total lung capacity

##Gas Exchange Testing
Include:
* Transfer factor (TLCO)

###Transfer Factor (TLCO/DLCO)
Measures the diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide, which can be used to calculate the functional surface area of the lungs. Involves:
* Laboratory test
* Involves:
	* Single-breath of 10% helium with 0.3% CO
		* Helium is minimally absorbed and so can be used to calculate the initial concentration of CO
		* CO is highly bound by Hb and so the partial pressure in the blood remains low, such that the primary determinant of CO absorption is the diffusing capacity of the lungs
	* Patient holds breath for 10-20s
	* First 750mL of gas is discarded  
	To ensure dead space removed.
	* Subsequent litre is analysed
	* Residual CO can be used to calculate how much CO has been absorbed
	* The amount of CO absorbed allows diffusing capacity to be calculated
* Reduced by:
	* Increased thickness  
	Fibrosis.
	* Decreased area  
	Lung resection, emphysema.
	* Reduced ability to bind to Hb  
	Anaemia.

##Other Tests
Include:
* Maximal breathing capacity
* Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
* 6-minute walk test

###Maximal Breathing Capacity  
Maximal volume of air that can be breathed when the subject hyperventilates as forcefully as possible:
* ⩽40% predicted indicates high perioperative risk


###Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing
Provides a functional assessment of cardiopulmonary reserve:
* Involves:
	* Exercising at increasing intensity on an exercise bike
	* Inspired and expired O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> are measured
	* Aims to calculate VO<sub>2</sub> max and anaerobic threshold
