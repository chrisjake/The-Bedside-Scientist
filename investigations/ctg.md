#Cardiotocograph

Cardiotocography is:
* Graphical representation of the relationship between FHR and uterine tone  
* Widely used tool to assess foetal wellbeing
	* Highly sensitive
	* Poorly specific


##Interpretation
Key features:
* **Baseline FHR**  
Mean FHR in bpm, when FHR is stable, over 5-10 minutes.
* **Baseline variability**  
Minor fluctuation in baseline FHR; as assessed by the difference in peak and trough FHR over one minute.
	* Normal 6-25 bpm
	* Reduced 3-5 bpm
	* Absent <3 bpm
	* Increased > 25 bpm
* **Accelerations**  
Transient increases of >15 bpm in FHR above baseline for at least 15s.
* **Decelerations**  
Transient decreases of >15 bpm in FHR below baseline for at least 15s. Subdivided into:
	* **Early decelerations**  
		* Benign  
		Usually head compression during a contraction.
		* Usually at 4-8cm cervical dilation
		* **Uniform** in shape
		* **Start** and **finish with** the **contraction**
	* **Variable decelerations**
		* Rapid onsent and recovery
		* Variable relationship with the contraction  
		Most are simultaneous with contraction.
		* **Signifiance** is **variable**
		* **Complicated variable** decelerations are **non-reassuring**, and occur with:
			* Rising baseline FHR
			* Foetal tachycardia
			* Reduced/absent baseline variability
			* Slow return to baseline FHR following contraction
			* Deceleration nadir following peak contraction
			* Large amplitude (60bpm) or long duration (60s) of deceleration
			* Post-deceleration overshoots
	* **Prolonged decelerations**  
	Deceleration lasting 90s to 5 minutes.
	* **Late decelerations**  
		* Uniform, repetitive deceleration with:
			* Slow onset in second half of contraction
			* Nadir >20s following peak of contraction
			* End after contraction finishes
		* Indication that contraction is occurring in the presence of foetal hypoxia  
		Therefore, will lack reasurring signs such as normal baseline variability, early decelerations.
		* May be <15 bpm if foetus is profoundly hypoxic
* **Sinusoidal**  
Smooth, regular oscillations at 2-5 cycles per minute with an amplitude of 5-15bpm. Indicates severe anaemia.

###Normal Intrapartum CTG
Low probability of foetal compromise. Features include:
* Baseline FHR  
110-160bpm.
* Normal baseline variability  
6-25bpm.
* Early or absent decelerations


###Non-Reassuring Features
*May* be associated with significant foetal compromise, and requires further action:
* Baseline foetal tachycardia  
>160 bpm.
* Reduced baseline variability  
3-5 bpm.
* Rising baseline FHR
* Complicated variable foetal decelerations
* Late decelerations
* Prolonged decelerations

***Likely*** to be **associated** with **significant foetal compromise**, and requires immediate intervention or **urgent delivery**:
* Prolonged bradycardia  
100bpm for >5 minutes.
* Absent baseline variability
* Complicated variable decelerations with reduced or absent variability
* Late decelerations with reduced or absent variability
