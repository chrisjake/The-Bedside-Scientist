The orbit:
* Takes a truncated pyramid shape
* Contains mostly fat
* Holds the globe in the anterior part  
The equator of the globe lies at the lateral border.

The globe is:
* Spherical
* Encased in **Tenon's capsule** over the scleral portion  
Elastic white connective tissue layer that surrounds the globe. It lies deep to the conjunctiva, which it merges with ~1mm from the limbus.
* Has six muscular attachments:
	* The four rectus muscles form the retrobulbar cone  
	Contact the walls of the orbit.
		* The intraconal space lies within these muscular attachments  
		Intraconal injection of local anaesthetic produces anaesthesia and akinesia of the globe and extraocular muscles.
		* The extraconal space is a potential space lying between these muscles and the orbital wall
