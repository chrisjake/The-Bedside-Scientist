The orbit:
* Takes a truncated pyramid shape
* Contains mostly fat
* Is divided into three parts, based on their contents:
	* **Intraocular compartment** contains the globe:
		* Lies anteriorly
		* Equator of the globe lies at the lateral border.
	* The **intraconal compartment** contains the **six** extraocular muscles  
	The inferior and lateral rectus muscles sit at inferiorly and nasally respectively, so the greatest gap between them lies is inferonasally.
		* The four rectus muscles form the retrobulbar cone  
		Contact the walls of the orbit.
			* The intraconal space lies within these muscular attachments  
			Intraconal injection of local anaesthetic produces anaesthesia and akinesia of the globe and extraocular muscles.
			* The extraconal space is a potential space lying between these muscles and the orbital wall
	* The **extraconal compartment**  
	Consists of fat sitting between the extraocular muscles and the bony walls of the orbit, and communicates freely with the intraconal component.

The globe is:
* Spherical
* Covered in three layers:
	* Cornea and sclera
		* Cornea is translucent and covers the iris
		* Sclera is opaque, and covers the rest  
		The circumferential junction of the cornea and the sclera is called the **limbus**.
	* **Tenon's capsule** covers the scleral portion  
Elastic white connective tissue layer that surrounds the globe. It lies deep to the conjunctiva, which it merges with ~1mm from the limbus.
* Attached to each of the extraocular muscles
* Divided into the anterior and posterior segments:
	* Anterior segment  
	Small, containing:
		* Aqueous humor
	* Posterior segment  
	Large, containing:
		* Lens
		* Vitreous
		* Retina
		* Macula
		* Optic nerve
	* Segments are separated by the iris, and communicate via the pupil
