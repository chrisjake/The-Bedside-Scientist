#Management of Post-Operative Cardiac Surgery

> * This section covers the intensive care management common to post-op cardiac surgical patients

Cardiac surgery is unique due to the:
* Type of procedure  
Common cardiac surgical procedures include:
	* Coronary Bypass Grafting
	* Valve repair/replacement
	* Aortic root repair/replacement
	* Repair of ASD/VSD
* Use of [Cardiopulmonary Bypass](/anaesthesia/cthr/cpb.md)
* Post-operative complications seen

##Initial Evaluation
Initial evaluation of the cardiac patient includes:
* History
* Examination
* Investigation

###History
Important facts when admitting a cardiac surgical patient include:
* Patient factors
	* Age
	* Sex
	* Operation
		* Elective
		* Emergent
	* Indication for operation
	* Preoperative angiogram  
	Vessels involved and degree of occlusion.
	* Preoperative echocardiogram  
	Systolic and diastolic function.
* Surgical factors
	* Operative findings  
		* Adequacy of graft targets  
		* Graft locations
		* Nature of valve repair or replacement
	* Bypass time and Aortic cross-clamp time
* Anaesthetic factors
	* Separation from bypass  
	Requirements for:
		* DCR
		* Inotropes/vasopressors
		* Nitric Oxide
		* Pacing
		* IABP
	* Post-reversal ACT


###Examination
Examination should involve:
* Airway
	* ETT position
* Breathing
	* Auscultation  
	Equal air entry.
	* Gas exchange  
	Review ABG.
	* Ventilation settings
* Circulation
	* Haemodynamic state
		* HR
		* BP
		* CO/CI
		* RAP + LAP/PCWP/PDP
	* Presence of murmurs
	* Adequacy of peripheral pulses
	* Drain
		* Patency
		* Outputs
* Disability
	* Pupils

###Investigations
Post-operative investigations should include:
* ABG
	* Adequacy of gas exchange
	* Lactataemia
	* Hb
	* Electrolyte abnormalities
* ECG  
Compare with preoperative ECG:
	* Common and benign post-operative changes include
		* RBBB
		* Pericarditic changes
	* Concerning changes include:
		* STE in continguous leads in a grafted vascular territory  
		May be acute graft failure.
		* Anterior STE  
		LIMA spasm in a LIMA-LAD graft.
* CXR
	* ETT position
	* PAC position
	* Drain position
	* NGT position
	* ICC position
	* PTHx
* Bloods
	* Hb
	* Platelets
	* Electrolytes
		* K<sup>+</sup>
		* Mg<sup>2+</sup>
	* Glucose
	* Coagulation panel
	* Cardiac markers  
	Always elevated post-cardiac surgery, but are useful in trending changes.

##Management
###Initial Mangement
Common initial management of the cardiac patient includes:
* Warming  
Should be rewarmed to >36°C. This:
	* Reduces arrythmia
	* Decreases SVR and myocardial work
	* Improves coagulopathy

###Haemodynamic Management
Haemodynamic impairment can be divided into problems with:
* Heart Rate/Rhythm
	* Causes:
		* Bradycardias  
		May be relative or absolute.
		* Tachyarrythmias  
		AF is very common post cardiac surgery.
	* Treatment:
		* Pacing
		* Electrolyte replacement
		* DCR
* Preload  
Impairment suggested by a low CO/CI, reduced filling, and a low MAP.
	* Causes include:
		* Hypovolaemia/haemorrhage  
		Associated with a relatively low CVP.
		* Cardiac tamponade  
		**Elevation and equalisation of diastolic pressures**.
* Afterload/SVR  
Low afterload is suggested by a high CO/CI and a low MAP.
	* Causes include
		* Post-pump vasoplegia/SIRS
		* Anaphylaxis
			* Protamine reactions
		* Drugs
			* Nitrates
			* Antihypertensives
			* Opioids
			* Sedation
		* Adrenal insufficiency
		* Neurogenic shock
		* Thyroid dysfunction
			* Hyperthyroidism
			* Hypothyroidism
	* Physiological treatment:
		* Vasopressors:
			* Noradrenaline  
			Begin at 1-5ug/min.
* Contractility  
Impairment suggested by a low CO/CI and a low MAP.
	* Causes:
		* Myocardial stunning  
		Suggested by long bypass time.
		* Graft dysfunction  
		May be spasm or acute graft occlusion.
			* Repeat ECG
		* Preoperative impairment
		* Acute vaovular regurgitation
	* Physiological treatment:
		* Inotropes:
			* Adrenaline  
			Begin at 0.5-1ug/min.
			* Dobutamine  
			Begin at 2.5ug/kg/min.
			* Milrinone


##Complications after Cardiac Surgery
Complications of cardiac surgery relevant to intensive care include:
* **Bleeding**  
	* **Medical bleeding**  
	Due to abnormalities of coagulation.
		* Causes of medical bleeding:
			* **Platelets**
				* Qualitative abnormality  
				Platelet function is decreased by:
					* Preoperative use of antiplatelet agents
					* Cardiopulmonary bypass  
					Greater bypass duration is associated with greater impairment.
				* Quantitative abnormality  
				Low number of platelets.
			* Coagulation abnormality
				* Residual heparinisation
				* Haemodilution
				* Consumption
			* Fibrinogen  
				* Plasminogen is activated by CPB
		* Treatment of medical bleeding:
			* Normalise temperature
			* Prevent hypertension
			* Correct platelet dysfunction:
				* Platelet transfusion  
				Aim *functional* platelet count >100 × 10<sup>9</sup> in significant bleeding.
				* DDAVP  
				Aim to improve platelet function.
					* 20ug IV
			* Correct coagulopathy  
			Aim to normalise APTT and PT.
				* Typically 20ml/kg of FFP
			* Correct fibrinogen  
			Aim to keep fibrinogen >1g/L.
			* Prevent fibrinolysis  
			Consider in the setting of fibrinolysis (i.e. elevated D-Dimer and low fibrinogen).
				* TXA
			* Increase mediastinal pressure  
			Theoretically reduce venous bleeding.
				* Increase PEEP
				* Raise head of bed
	* **Surgical bleeding**  
	Due to uncontrolled (typically arterial) source. Suggested by:
		* Bleeding with normal coagulation parameters
		* Large volume drain outputs  
			* >500ml in 1 hour
			* >400ml/hr for 2 hours
			* >300ml/hr for 3 horus
			* >200ml/hr for 4 hours
		* Bleeding following period of extreme hypertension
* **Cardiac Tamponade**  
Collection of fluid (blood) around the heart, impairing filling and therefore CO.
	* Up to 5%
	* Clinical diagnosis
	* Features:
		* Tachycardia
		* Low UO
		* Fall in CO/SV/MVO<sub>2</sub>
		* Elevation and equalisation of diastolic pressures  
		RAP ≃ PADP ≃ PCWP.
			* May not occur if a small clot occurs around and impedes filing to only one chamber.
		* Loss of y-descent on CVP waveform  
		Indicates that the pressure gradient between the atria and the ventricles is reduced.
		* Loss of mediastinal drain output
		* Echocardiography
	* Treatment
		* Resternotomy and evacuation of clot
