>Facts that are useful but don't fit cleanly into a current section

* Endocrine crises depend on the underlying condition (e.g. hypothyroidism) and a physiological stress (surgery, illness) that exacerbates that condition


* AF is a disease of disorganised conduction  
Does not relate to the presence or absence of P waves; but its relationship to the QRS.
	* Degree of atrial activity is often seen, especially in V<sub>1</sub>
	* Difficult to convert to sinus but easy to rate control

AF Mx:
* Find cause
	* Ischaemia
	* CM
	* Infection
	* Anaemia
	* TFTs
* Fix
* Control rate  
Rate control better as less strokes than rhythm control (on warfarin, different now?).
	* Rhythm control good for sick patients who need the atrial kick
* Anticoagulate

* AFlutter
	* Very shockable

* RBBB in isolation is not associated with RAD because the bulk of depolarisation is still heading to the LV

* Q waves take ~8 hours to occur after infarction
* Q waves should be ~1/3rd of the R wave it proceeds, unless infarction is occurring


* ST elevation in III > II with ST elevation in aVL suggests RCA lesion
* ST elevation in II > II with ST elevation in aVL suggests LCx lesion


* J point is 60-80ms from the deepest part of the S wave


* Upward deflections in V1<sub>1</sub> are (almost) always pathological
	* RVH  
	PHTN, PE.
	* RV infarct
	* Lead placement
	* Dextrocardia
	* RBBB
	* WPW

* QRS duration is the speed of conduction through the myocardium  
Quantifies, to a degree, the ejection fraction.
	* Short QRS; rapid & efficient conduction -> probable good ejection
	* Prolonged QRS; slow conduction -> potentially bad conduction  


* LBBB should be evaluated pre-operatively some way, especially if new, and even if asymptomatic


* Perioperative cardiac function:
	* LV function
	* Exercise tolerance


* RVOT VT spreads towards cardiac apex; has LBBB morphology  
May be able to be managed medically.
* VT with RBBB; LV source (usually myocardial scar from infarct)


* CHB risk is related to escape rhythm
	* Junctional escape suggests purkinje system intact and is relatively less urgent  
	But should be done before anaesthesia.
	* Ventricular escape suggests need for pacing


* WPW
	* Pre-excitation = short PR interval
	* Delta wave = slurring in first 50% of QRS
	* Usually okay if not in AF  
	In AF, its like having VF - unfiltered pathway conducts all the atrial activity through to the ventricle.
	* Requires class I drugs or DCC


EEG in ICU:
* Monitor burst suppression
* Diagnosis undifferentiated conscious impairment
* Diagnose NCSE
* Prognosticate hypoxic brain injury
* Early diagnosis vasospasm


Mannitol contraindications:
* Na >150
* Osm >320


Easy epilepsy loading doses:
* Phenytoin 20mg/kg
* Valproate 40mg/kg
* Levetiracetam 60mg/kg


PRBC transfusion incrementsS:
* 4ml/kg increases Hb by ~10g/L


##Midface Fractures
* Airway control important
* Blood major issue
* Laryngoscopy usually straightforward
* Then realign face
* Usually interventional radiology in first instance
* Bite blocks and splints
* Then surgery in a few days when swelling has improved


##Impact Brain Apnoea

##Cryoprecipitate & Transfusion
* 10-250mg fibrinogen in each bag  
Median 150mg.
* Give calcium every second unit of blood

##PRBC
Physiology:
* pH 6.5
* K ⩾25mmol/L


##TEG/ROTEM
* Point of care viscoelastic test for measurement of coagulation function

##Cyclical Hyper-resuscitation


##Visceral Organ Injury
* Bradycardia/lack of tachycardiac due to vagal stimulation despite inadequate organ confusion


##End-Points of Resuscitation
Values indicating critical physiological derangement include:
* Temperature ⩽35
* pH ⩾7.2
* Ionised Calcium ⩽1
* Plt ⩾50
* INR ⩾1.5
* APTT
* Fibrinogen level ⩽1



##Blood Resuscitation
Paeds: 10ml/kg of all blood product is a good guide


#Posterior fossa craniectomy
Posterior fossa craniectomy have more VAE than supine
Not much room for surgical operation
Haemodynamic instability from manipulating brainstem cardiac centres
Obstructive hydrocephalus



##Awake crani
* Patient selection, counselling
* art line and IV on ipsilateral side
* Empty bladder
* Warming blanket
* TEDS, no calf compressors
* Intra-operative awake/asleep/awake

##Coiling
Coiling:
* Remote
* Radiation
* Radiology equipment
* Heparin requirement



#Aortic stenosis echo
* Echo pressure measurements are based on velocity, cath lab based pressure measurements are based on actual pressure
* Peak velocity is based on the maximal pressure gradient, which does not occur at peak aortic pressure but on the actual upstroke of the LV
* Echo tables therefore will overestimate the degree of stenosis compared to cath lab measurements

##Mitral valve
* Anterior leaflet ~1/3 of anulus
* Posterior leaflet ~2/3 of annulus
* Omniplane:
	* 0 deg cuts A2 P2
	* 60deg cuts along commissure and gives the P3, A2, P1 view
	* 90deg cuts through A2 P3
	* 150deg cuts through P2 A2 again


##Cardioplegia
* Various types


##Radiopaedia note:
* L LL sits at base of heart down to diaphragm
* Lingula touches left heart border
* RML covers R heart border

##Anatomy of a bypass circuit



##Systemic review
* Clearly stated set of objectives with pre-defined eligibility criteria
* Explicit and reproducible methodology


#Meta analysis
* Combined results of several studies with values weighted by various quality criteria
* Funnel plot: is my study representative

##RCTs
* Obtain two similar groups, treated identically, except for intervention vs control
* Followed up identically
* Statistical difference on a predefined outcome which is clinically relevant
* Use CONSORT criteria when interpreting studies  
* 5 major questions:
	* Should this study have been performed?
		* Originality
		* Incremental
		* Significance
	* Is the methodology flawed?

##Bias
* Selection
* Performance  
Difference in care outside of the intervention.
* Detection
* Attrition
* Reporting

##Odds and risk
* RR is a ratio of rates, and expresses comparative likelihoods of events between populations
* OR is a ratio of odds, looking at relative likelihoods of events given EXPOSURES

##Post resuscitation care
CO2; aim 50-55
O2: aim low normal
Temp: 33 to 36 degrees
SBP >100
Control glucose


##Ventilation strategy
* PEEP 14-16 well tolerated and seems greatest bang for buck with damaged lung
* Automated recruitment on GE machines
* Benefit seen in ARDSnet but reversed in ROSE; probably because ventilator dyssynchrony reduced with better ventilators and ventilation modes
* PCV maximises driving pressure throughout the entire breath
	* Alveoli peak early due to high pressure gradient in proximal airway
	* Higher initial flow
	* More of Vt delivered early in inspiratory cycle
	* Vt better distributed among alveoli with different time constants


##Hyponatraemia & friends
John Reeves talk:
* Diagnose based on osmoles
* Treat based on volume
* Urinary sodium is a function of the bodies impression of its volume state
* Hiller Am J Med 1999 correcting sodium; rule of thumb; for every 3mmol/L increase in BSL the sodium will fall by 1  
Corrected sodium useful to assess total volume deficit; e.g. in DKA, look at difference between corrected sodium and normal sodium, normal sodium deficit.
* Acute kidney injuries, the urea and creatinine rise proportionally
* Chronic kidney failure, the creatinine rises disproportionately to the urea
* Random conditions, the urea will rise disproportionately to the creatinine
	* Water depletion
	* GI haemorrhage
	* Catabolism
	* Pulse steroids

Liver function:
* INR best index of rapid progression
* Albumin and globulins indicators of synthetic function
* ALP and GGT indicate duct damage
* Transaminases detect hepatocyte damage


* HCO3 should move 2mmol/L for each 10mmHg change in CO2


##Ethics
Ethical practice:
* Autonomy  
Right to make own decisions. Advanced care directive is to defend autonomy when they no longer have capacity.
	* Opposite is paternalism  
	Any restriction of a patients autonomy, motivated or presented as being justified by interest in the patients well-being.
* Beneficence  
The duty to do the best for the patient.
	* Duty to do good
	* Difficult to decide what is best?  
	Patient, doctor, hospital administration, etc.
* Non-maleficence  
Duty to do no harm.
	* Doctrine of double effect  
	Intended good effect morally outweighs negative effects, provided that negative effect is not intended, even if it is foreseen. 
		* The action itself must be morally indifferent or morally good
		* The bad effect must not be the means by which the good effect is achieved
		* The motive must be the achievement of the good effect
		* The good effect must be at least equivalent in importance to the bad effet
	* Can be tested with the **Sulmasy test**  
	e.g. IN palliative care; if the patient did not die as a result of my actions, would I feel I achieved what I set out to do? If no, then okay.
* Justice
	* Distribute justice  
	Fair distribution of scarce resources. Many ways to define fair:
		* Equal share
		* By need
		* By effort
		* By contribution
		* By merit
		* By free-market exchanges
	* Rights based justice  
	Respect for peoples rights.
* Fidelity  
Act in ways that are loyal.
	* Role fidelity  
	Act appropriately to your job.
* Utility  
Greatest good for greatest number.

#FOI Speel
I would thoroughly explain the process to the patient, that it may take some time, and the possibility of discomfort.

I would gain IV access, and give 200-400ug of glycopyrrolate IV as an antisialagogue. I would apply nasal prong oxygen and commence remifentanil TCI at 1ng/ml, titrating to patient comfort whilst ensuring they remain spontaneously ventilating.

For nasal FOI, I would:
* Identify the most patent nostril
* Ensure I am not using more than 9mg/kg lignocaine total
* Spray the nostril with 1-3 sprays of cophenylcaine
* Serially dilate with NPAs
	* From a small size up to 0.5 size above the intended tube size
	* Using lignocaine 2% viscous gel on the first NPA
	* Using copious lubricant on the other NPAs
* Whilst dilating, I would spray 10% lignocaine via MAD over 5 minutes, targeting the:
	* Oropharynx
	* Tonsillar pillars
	* Base of tongue
* Load Parker Flex tube onto the bronch
* Use ETT as an introducer for bronchoscope into nasopharynx
* Advance bronchoscope into oropharynx and identify glottis
* Use 2% lignocaine spray-as-I-go to anaesthetise larynx
* Spray into trachea to anaesthetise carina
* Advance bronchoscope to carina
* Advance tube over bronchoscope
* Secure airway and confirm ventilation with CO2 monitoring
* Commence anaesthesia


For oral FOI, I would:


##Aintree

* 6.5mm OD (fits a 7.0 tube)
* 56cm long

##Metaanalysis
i-squared: Percentage of variability  	


##Exam Stuff
Overall:
* Impossible to completely prepare
* Odds are in your favour
* Likely that blue book won't cover MCQs but may cover vivas
	* Blue book 2017 will be about right though...

MCQ and SAQ:
* **ANZCA networks high yield**
	* Anaesthesia learning module?
* Review questions and vivas over the last 2 years; highly likely MCQs and SAQs will relate to these topics
* One examiner marks each question  
Random double-marker.
	* Illegibility, spelling errors are penalised by examiner frustration
* Questions aimed to be answered in ~8 minutes
	* Generally easy to get the main points
	* Time management important
	* Low yield after the main points
* Recent questions from FRCA and CICM good for vogue topics

Med viva:
* Should mostly be chronic stable disease
* Rarely acute
* Almost never a DDx
* Patients tend to be institionalised and pretty good historians
* Scoring systems (NYHA etc) are good, but if not applicable to your disease then score based on their functional impact
* Sometimes a bit chaotic on day due to nature of patients, so less standardised than usual
* Want an organised, empathic, listening approach to patient and getting information relevant to you as an anaesthetist
* Respect and rapport with the patient is vital and "you will be punished severely" if you cause pain or are not respectful
* Wear suit and tie or equivalent
* Stem on door will direct you to a system; focus on that system first and then and only then go outside of that system if it is relevant and you have time
* In general questions shouldn't focus on perioperative issues, but that may happen with weird shit because they don't know what else to talk about
* Investigations are a big part of this exam
	* More detail on spirometry including MMEF, peak and end expiratory flow, shape of waveform and why (seem to want more detail than most of the online resources have)
	* Lead with the big stuff up front (e.g. there is a massive anterior STEMI), and then go through the detailed bit -> normally they will cut you off if you got the major things
* Most common mistake is failure to listen to the patient

Trends in people who fail:
* Haven't used ANZCA networks
* Haven't used the taxonomy for SAQs
* Lack of organisation

Vivas:
* Three areas to work through
* Make decision and justify your management
* Avoid diving too deep too soon
* Admit ignorance if complex cases that you haven't done  
"I haven't done this but I am aware of these issues (list), and would seek advice of a senior and experienced colleague"
* Grab lifelines when offered
* Don't dive into crisis mode inappropriately early; demonstrates not ready for independent practice


##TOE
Goal & good at:
* Demonstrate anatomical aspects of valvular pathology
* Provide assurance that surgical technique successful
* Haemodynamic monitoring
* Anatomical monitoring
	* AV, MV, TV
	* Base of heart


Not so good at:
* Visualising
	* PV
	* Apex
* Physiology  
Requires anaesthetic and therefore changes physiology from patients usual loading conditions.
	* Regurgitant lesions appear better due to reduced afterload
	* Aortic stenosis  
	Appear less severe because reduced contractility.
	* Grading severity  
	Good at looking at WHY a lesion exists, once the physiology is graded on TTE.


Demonstrated use:
* When a cardiac chamber is opened:
	* Valve repair
	* Congenital cardiac
	* HOCM
	* Endocarditis
* Dissection
* Unexplained severe hypotension


Maybe used:
* Lung transplant
* Liver transplant
* Major non-cardiac with severe symptomatic haemodynamic response


Diastolic function assessment:
* Grades
	* Normal
	* Grade I/impaired relaxation	
	Relaxing more slowly than normal but no compensatory rise in LAP. Is normal in >65 year olds.
	* Grade II/pseudonormal  
	Slowly relaxing ventricle but some compensation by a moderate rise in LAP.
	* Grade III/restrictive filling  
	Severe relaxation failure accommodated by high LAP and LV remodelling.
	* Grade IV/fixed  
	Severe unfixable relaxation failure
* Measurement
	* Pulse wave doppler through tips of mitral valve leaflets
	* Gives E/A
		* E wave
			* Pressure gradient between LA and LV  
			High with:
				* High LV negative pressure
				* High LA filling pressure
		* A wave
			* Pressure gradient generated by atrial contraction and LV
			* Atria has no valves and is pretty weak so can only generate ~5mmHg of additional pressure
		* Normally, atrial kick is more important and so A usually > E, i.e. E/A <1
		* With deterioration:
			* Grade I: LVEDP increases, which reduces diastolic filling (smaller E wave) but atrial kick still relatively reasonably decent, and so E/A reversal occurs (A bigger than E)
			* Grade II: LAP (filling) pressures increase so gradient is restored. Atria is still a little bitch and so its contribution is relatively small against the increased LV DP so E>A. Looks "normal" from a FLOW point of view on echo, but the pressures are higher.
				* Valsalva will reduce LA filling pressures, which will restore "normal" filling pressures and therefore E phase filling is reduced and A>E again. This allows pseudonormal to be differentiated from grade I dysfunction.
			* Grade III: E wave becomes progressively larger as LAP increases, and A wave becomes smaller because the little bitch atrium can't contract against such high LV pressures.
			* Grade IV:
			* As ventricle gets stiffer, its diastolic filling time reduces because it distends so quickly. E wave duration shortens because the ventricle fills (and stops filling) so quickly.
		* E/E'
			* E': Velocity of submitral myocardium in early diastole; measured at septum and lateral wall (septum usually lower). Indicates how fast the ventricle is relaxing. Related to:
				* How well the LV is relaxing (sucking)
				* How hard the filling pressure is pushing (blowing)
			* E/E' accounts for the blowing portion to better estimate the sucking


Aortic stenosis:
* DI
	* Least assumptions
	* Probably the most accurate, barring issues with CW doppler (e.g. outflow tract obstruction)
* AVA
	* Derived from DI
* MPG  
Can be a function bad AS (high gradient) or bad LV function (low gradient). Compare with DI and stress TTE?


LV function:
* EF
* FS
* GLS
	* Integrated measurement of change in length of myocardium
	* -18 normal, less negative is worse (less movement)



##NIRS
Cerebral oximetry:
* Principles similar to pulse oximetry and spatial resolution
* Algorithmically correct for saturation of extracranial blood
* Values are derived mainly from venous blood and are independent of pulsatile blood flow
* Use
	* Collect baseline prior to induction  
	Usual is 60-80%.
	* Factors affecting oxygenation:
		* Cerebral blood flow
			* CO
			* Acid-base
			* Haemorrhage
			* Arterial inflow/venous outflow
		* Oxygen content
			* [Hb]
			* Hb saturation
			* Lung function
			* FiO2
	* Optimise based on the above factors
	* Reduction of 12-20% from baseline suggests brain ischaemia
* Limitations
	* Extracranial blood saturation
	* Diathermy
	* Only measures regional saturation
	* Don't detect cause

##Blood Gas Corrections
2 and 4 are just as good and easier to remember.
i.e. for every 10 change in CO2, bicarb will chagne acutely by 2 and chronically by  4.
