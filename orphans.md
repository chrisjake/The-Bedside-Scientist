Facts that are useful but don't fit cleanly into a current section:

* Endocrine crises depend on the underlying condition (e.g. hypothyroidism) and a physiological stress (surgery, illness) that exacerbates that condition


* AF is a disease of disorganised conduction  
Does not relate to the presence or absence of P waves; but its relationship to the QRS.
	* Degree of atrial activity is often seen, especially in V<sub>1</sub>
	* Difficult to convert to sinus but easy to rate control

AF Mx:
* Find cause
	* Ischaemia
	* CM
	* Infection
	* Anaemia
	* TFTs
* Fix
* Control rate  
Rate control better as less strokes than rhythm control (on warfarin, different now?).
	* Rhythm control good for sick patients who need the atrial kick
* Anticoagulate

* AFlutter
	* Very shockable

* RBBB in isolation is not associated with RAD because the bulk of depolarisation is still heading to the LV

* Q waves take ~8 hours to occur after infarction
* Q waves should be ~1/3rd of the R wave it proceeds, unless infarction is occurring


* ST elevation in III > II with ST elevation in aVL suggests RCA lesion
* ST elevation in II > II with ST elevation in aVL suggests LCx lesion


* J point is 60-80ms from the deepest part of the S wave


* Upward deflections in V1<sub>1</sub> are (almost) always pathological
	* RVH  
	PHTN, PE.
	* RV infarct
	* Lead placement
	* Dextrocardia
	* RBBB
	* WPW

* QRS duration is the speed of conduction through the myocardium  
Quantifies, to a degree, the ejection fraction.
	* Short QRS; rapid & efficient conduction -> probable good ejection
	* Prolonged QRS; slow conduction -> potentially bad conduction  


* LBBB should be evaluated pre-operatively some way, especially if new, and even if asymptomatic


* Perioperative cardiac function:
	* LV function
	* Exercise tolerance


* RVOT VT spreads towards cardiac apex; has LBBB morphology  
May be able to be managed medically.
* VT with RBBB; LV source (usually myocardial scar from infarct)


* CHB risk is related to escape rhythm
	* Junctional escape suggests purkinje system intact and is relatively less urgent  
	But should be done before anaesthesia.
	* Ventricular escape suggests need for pacing


* WPW
	* Pre-excitation = short PR interval
	* Delta wave = slurring in first 50% of QRS
	* Usually okay if not in AF  
	In AF, its like having VF - unfiltered pathway conducts all the atrial activity through to the ventricle.
	* Requires class I drugs or DCC
