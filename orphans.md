#Orphans
Facts that are useful but don't fit cleanly into a current section:

* Endocrine crises depend on the underlying condition (e.g. hypothyroidism) and a physiological stress (surgery, illness) that exacerbates that condition


* AF is a disease of disorganised conduction  
Does not relate to the presence or absence of P waves; but its relationship to the QRS.
	* Degree of atrial activity is often seen, especially in V<sub>1</sub>
	* Difficult to convert to sinus but easy to rate control

AF Mx:
* Find cause
	* Ischaemia
	* CM
	* Infection
	* Anaemia
	* TFTs
* Fix
* Control rate  
Rate control better as less strokes than rhythm control (on warfarin, different now?).
	* Rhythm control good for sick patients who need the atrial kick
* Anticoagulate

* AFlutter
	* Very shockable

* RBBB in isolation is not associated with RAD because the bulk of depolarisation is still heading to the LV

* Q waves take ~8 hours to occur after infarction
* Q waves should be ~1/3rd of the R wave it proceeds, unless infarction is occurring


* ST elevation in III > II with ST elevation in aVL suggests RCA lesion
* ST elevation in II > II with ST elevation in aVL suggests LCx lesion


* J point is 60-80ms from the deepest part of the S wave


* Upward deflections in V1<sub>1</sub> are (almost) always pathological
	* RVH  
	PHTN, PE.
	* RV infarct
	* Lead placement
	* Dextrocardia
	* RBBB
	* WPW

* QRS duration is the speed of conduction through the myocardium  
Quantifies, to a degree, the ejection fraction.
	* Short QRS; rapid & efficient conduction -> probable good ejection
	* Prolonged QRS; slow conduction -> potentially bad conduction  


* LBBB should be evaluated pre-operatively some way, especially if new, and even if asymptomatic


* Perioperative cardiac function:
	* LV function
	* Exercise tolerance


* RVOT VT spreads towards cardiac apex; has LBBB morphology  
May be able to be managed medically.
* VT with RBBB; LV source (usually myocardial scar from infarct)


* CHB risk is related to escape rhythm
	* Junctional escape suggests purkinje system intact and is relatively less urgent  
	But should be done before anaesthesia.
	* Ventricular escape suggests need for pacing


* WPW
	* Pre-excitation = short PR interval
	* Delta wave = slurring in first 50% of QRS
	* Usually okay if not in AF  
	In AF, its like having VF - unfiltered pathway conducts all the atrial activity through to the ventricle.
	* Requires class I drugs or DCC


EEG in ICU:
* Monitor burst suppression
* Diagnosis undifferentiated conscious impairment
* Diagnose NCSE
* Prognosticate hypoxic brain injury
* Early diagnosis vasospasm


Mannitol contraindications:
* Na >150

Easy epilepsy loading doses:
* Phenytoin 20mg/kg
* Valproate 40mg/kg
* Levetiracetam 60mg/kg


PRBC transfusion incrementsS:
* 4ml/kg increases Hb by ~10g/L


##Midface Fractures
* Airway control important
* Blood major issue
* Laryngoscopy usually straightforward
* Then realign face
* Usually interventional radiology in first instance
* Bite blocks and splints
* Then surgery in a few days when swelling has improved


##Impact Brain Apnoea

##Cryoprecipitate & Transfusion
* 10-250mg fibrinogen in each bag  
Median 150mg.
* Give calcium every second unit of blood

* K ⩾25mmol/L


##TEG/ROTEM
* Point of care viscoelastic test for measurement of coagulation function

##Cyclical Hyper-resuscitation


##Visceral Organ Injury

##End-Points of Resuscitation
Values indicating critical physiological derangement include:
* Temperature ⩽35
* pH ⩾7.2
* Ionised Calcium ⩽1
* Plt ⩾50
* INR ⩾1.5
* APTT
* Fibrinogen level ⩽1



##Blood Resuscitation
Paeds: 10ml/kg of all blood product is a good guide


#Posterior fossa craniectomy
Posterior fossa craniectomy have more VAE than supine
Not much room for surgical operation
Haemodynamic instability from manipulating brainstem cardiac centres
Obstructive hydrocephalus

##Clot Retrieval
* NNT 5 for independence and 3 for discharge
	* Within 5 hours of onset
* Can be extended up to 24 hours in selected patients with favourable imaging
* Time critical
* Appropriate patient selection
	* Proven large vessel occlusion (ICA, MCA, M1, M2, basilar)
* Arrange brain imaging
	* Review brain imaging results
	* Communicate with neurointerventionalist
	* Transfer to angiography suite for treatment


Issues:
* Patient position
* HDx stability
* Maintain SBP 140-180 or within 10% of baseline
- Maintain sats, CO2 35-40
* Normothermia, normoglycaemia
* Anticoagulation
* GA vs sedation; trend is better with sedation

##Awake crani
* Patient selection, counselling
* art line and IV on ipsilateral side
* Empty bladder
* Warming blanket
* TEDS, no calf compressors
* Intra-operative awake/asleep/awake

##Coiling
Coiling:
* Remote
* Radiation
* Radiology equipment
* Heparin requirement



#Aortic stenosis echo
* Echo pressure measurements are based on velocity, cath lab based pressure measurements are based on actual pressure
* Peak velocity is based on the maximal pressure gradient, which does not occur at peak aortic pressure but on the actual upstroke of the LV
* Echo tables therefore will overestimate the degree of stenosis compared to cath lab measurements

##Mitral valve
* Anterior leaflet ~1/3 of anulus
* Posterior leaflet ~2/3 of annulus
* Omniplane:
	* 0 deg cuts A2 P2
	* 60deg cuts along commissure and gives the P3, A2, P1 view
	* 90deg cuts through A2 P3
	* 150deg cuts through P2 A2 again


##Cardioplegia
* Various types


##Radiopaedia note:
* L LL sits at base of heart down to diaphragm
* Lingula touches left heart border

##Anatomy of a bypass circuit



##Systemic review
* Clearly stated set of objectives with pre-defined eligibility criteria
* Explicit and reproducible methodology


#Meta analysis
* Combined results of several studies with values weighted by various quality criteria
* Funnel plot: is my study representative

##RCTs
* Obtain two similar groups, treated identically, except for intervention vs control
* Followed up identically
* Statistical difference on a predefined outcome which is clinically relevant
* Use CONSORT criteria when interpreting studies  
* 5 major questions:
	* Should this study have been performed?
		* Originality
		* Incremental
		* Significance
	* Is the methodology flawed?

##Bias
* Selection
* Performance  
Difference in care outside of the intervention.
* Detection
* Attrition
* Reporting

##Odds and risk
* RR is a ratio of rates, and expresses comparative likelihoods of events between populations
* OR is a ratio of odds, looking at relative likelihoods of events given EXPOSURES

##Post resuscitation care
CO2; aim 50-55
O2: aim low normal
Temp: 33 to 36 degrees
SBP >100
Control glucose


##Ventilation strategy
* PEEP 14-16 well tolerated and seems greatest bang for buck with damaged lung
* Automated recruitment on GE machines
* Benefit seen in ARDSnet but reversed in ROSE; probably because ventilator dyssynchrony reduced with better ventilators and ventilation modes
* PCV maximises driving pressure throughout the entire breath
	* Alveoli peak early due to high pressure gradient in proximal airway
	* Higher initial flow
	* More of Vt delivered early in inspiratory cycle
	* Vt better distributed among alveoli with different time constants


##Hyponatraemia & friends
John Reeves talk:
* Diagnose based on osmoles
* Treat based on volume
* Urinary sodium is a function of the bodies impression of its volume state
* Hiller Am J Med 1999 correcting sodium; rule of thumb; for every 3mmol/L increase in BSL the sodium will fall by 1  
Corrected sodium useful to assess total volume deficit; e.g. in DKA, look at difference between corrected sodium and normal sodium, normal sodium deficit.
* Acute kidney injuries, the urea and creatinine rise proportionally
* Chronic kidney failure, the creatinine rises disproportionately to the urea
* Random conditions, the urea will rise disproportionately to the creatinine
	* Water depletion
	* GI haemorrhage
	* Catabolism
	* Pulse steroids

Liver function:
* INR best index of rapid progression
* Albumin and globulins indicators of synthetic function
* ALP and GGT indicate duct damage
* Transaminases detect hepatocyte damage


* HCO3 should move 2mmol/L for each 10mmHg change in CO2


##Ethics
Ethical practice:
* Autonomy  
Right to make own decisions. Advanced care directive is to defend autonomy when they no longer have capacity.
	* Opposite is paternalism  
	Any restriction of a patients autonomy, motivated or presented as being justified by interest in the patients well-being.
* Beneficence  
The duty to do the best for the patient.
	* Duty to do good
	* Difficult to decide what is best?  
	Patient, doctor, hospital administration, etc.
* Non-maleficence  
Duty to do no harm.
	* Doctrine of double effect  
	Intended good effect morally outweighs negative effects, provided that negative effect is not intended, even if it is foreseen. 
		* The action itself must be morally indifferent or morally good
		* The bad effect must not be the means by which the good effect is achieved
		* The motive must be the achievement of the good effect
		* The good effect must be at least equivalent in importance to the bad effet
	* Can be tested with the **Sulmasy test**  
	e.g. IN palliative care; if the patient did not die as a result of my actions, would I feel I achieved what I set out to do? If no, then okay.
* Justice
	* Distribute justice  
	Fair distribution of scarce resources. Many ways to define fair:
		* Equal share
		* By need
		* By effort
		* By contribution
		* By merit
		* By free-market exchanges
	* Rights based justice  
	Respect for peoples rights.
* Fidelity  
Act in ways that are loyal.
	* Role fidelity  
	Act appropriately to your job.
* Utility  
Greatest good for greatest number.
