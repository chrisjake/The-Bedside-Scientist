#Epidural Catheters


##Indications
Epidural catheters are commonly used for:
* Analgesia
    * Major abdominal or thoracic surgery  
    In combination with a general anaesthetic.
    * Labor
    * Chronic pain
* Anaesthesia
    * As a sole technique, e.g. epidural top-up
    * As a combined spinal-epidural technique

    
        
##Contraindications
Absolute contraindications:
* Patient refusal
* Coagulopathy  
    * Epidural should be withheld in patients with pre-existing coagulopathy where intraoperative heparin administration is planned.
    * Coagulation studies be performed prior to insertion  
    Risk of haematoma exists on a continuum - a platelet count of 79 is not substantially more risky than a platelet count of 81.
        * Any abnormality of coagulation is always a *relative* contraindication
        * Risk varies depending on technique  
        Paravertebral is less risky than a spinal, which is less risky than a single-shot epidural, which is less risky than an epidural catheter.
        * Absolute thresholds will vary depending on the centre; one particular set of numbers is:
            * Normal APTT
            * INR < 1.5
            * Platelets > 80 x 10<sup>12</sup>/L  
* Presence of anticoagulants  
See table below.
* Sepsis

Relative contraindications:
* Immunocompromise

###Management of Anticoagulants

|Drug|Time between last dose and epidural insertion/adjustment/removal|Time before next dose|
|--|--|--|
|**Heparin** <br>5,000 Units S/C|6 hours.|6 hours.|
|**Heparin** Infusion|6 hours since cessation, and a normal APTT.|Restart 8 hours after infusion, or 24 hours if bloody tap.|
|**Heparin** IV intraoperative|Removal > 4 hours after last dose.|1 hour between placement and first dose.
|**Enoxaparin** (prophylactic)|12 hours, 24 hours post-operative.|2 hours|
|**Enoxaparin** (therapeutic)|24 hours.|2 hours|
|**Warfarin**|INR < 1.5 prior to insertion. Warfarin cannot be used with an epidural in situ - use UFH.|INR < 1.5 prior to removal.|
|**Aspirin**|2-3 days prior to cervical/thoracic epidural placement.|-|
|**NSAIDs**|-|-|
|**Clopidogrel**|7 days for insertion. Should not be initiated with epidural in situ.|
|**Rivaroxaban**|At least 2 days.|6 hours.
|**GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors**|At least 2 days. Seek expert advice.|Seek expert advice.
|**Dabigatran**|48 hours||
|**Thrombin inhibitors** including bivalirudin, lepirudin|Avoid. Seek expert advice.|Seek expert advice.
|**Thrombolytics**|10 days.|Measure fibrinogen level prior to removal. Seek expert advice.|
|**Herbal** including garglic, gingseng, and gingo bilboa|-|-|


##Anatomy
Lumbar:
* Generally between L2 and L5 interspaces
* Epidural space is an average of 5cm  (3-8 in 90%)

Thoracic:
* Avoid midline approach between T5 and T8

Cervical:
* Thin and soft ligamentum flavum leads to poor appreciation of LoR
* Space is ~ 1.5-2mm deep at C7, increases to 3-4mm with neck flexion


##Equipment


##Technique
* Preparation
* Procedure
* Post
* Removal


##Complications
* Dural puncture (~1/100)  
Post-dural puncture headache.
* Hypotension (Up to ~1/30)  
May lead to nausea.
* Respiratory depression (~1/200)
* Epidural haematoma (~1/150,000)  
Affected by:
    * Intra-abdominal pressure  
    High IAP impairs epidural venous drainage.
    * Needle size
    * Use of anticoagulants
* Epidural abscess (0.05%)  
* Neurological damage (0.5%)   
    * Typically transient
    * Majority associated with motor block rather than pain
    * Poorer outcomes are associated with:
        * Delayed (> 24 hour) presention
        * No surgical intervention
    * Severe neurological damage is associated with:
        * Delayed diagnosis of haematoma or abscess
        * Haematoma in 50% of cases
        * Administration of heparin intraoperatively in > 50% of cases
        * Presence of pre-existing coagulation abnormality in 75% of cases
* High block
* Urinary retention  
    * IDC placement
* Itch  
    * Due to presence of opioids within epidural
