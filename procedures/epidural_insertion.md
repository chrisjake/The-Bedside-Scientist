#Epidural Catheters

Epidural catheters are commonly used for:
* Analgesia
    * Major abdominal or thoracic surgery  
    In combination with a general anaesthetic.
    * Labor
    * Chronic pain
* Anaesthesia
    * As a sole technique, e.g. epidural top-up
    * As a combined spinal-epidural technique

##Risks
* Dural puncture (~1/100)
* Hypotension (Up to ~1/30)
* Respiratory depression (~1/200)
* Epidural haematoma (~1/150,000)  
Affected by:
    * Intra-abdominal pressure  
    High IAP impairs epidural venous drainage.
    * Needle size
    * Use of anticoagulants
* Epidural abscess (0.05%)
* Neurological damage (0.5%)   
    * Typically transient
    * Severe neurological damage is associated with:
        * Delayed diagnosis of haematoma or abscess
        * Haematoma in 50% of cases
        * Administration of heparin intraoperatively in > 50% of cases
        * Presence of pre-existing coagulation abnormality in 75% of cases
        
        
##Contraindications
Absolute contraindications:
* Patient refusal
* Coagulopathy  
Coagulation studies be performed prior to insertion, and should demonstrate:
    * Normal APTT
    * Normal INR
    * Platelets > 80 x 10<sup>12</sup>/L
* Presence of anticoagulants  
See table below.
* Sepsis

Relative contraindications:
* Immunocompromise

###Management of Anticoagulants

|Drug|Time between last dose and epidural insertion/adjustment/removal|Time before next dose|
|--|--|--|
|**Heparin** <br>5,000 Units S/C|6 hours.|6 hours.|
|**Heparin** Infusion|6 hours since cessation, and a normal APTT.|Restart 8 hours after infusion, or 24 hours if bloody tap.|
|**Enoxaparin** (prophylactic)|
|**Enoxaparin** (therapeutic)|
|**Warfarin**|INR < 1.5 prior to insertion. Warfarin cannot be used with an epidural in situ - use UFH.|INR < 1.5 prior to removal.|
|**Aspirin**|-|-|
|**NSAIDs**|-|-|
|**Clopidogrel**|Should not be initiated with epidural in situ.|
|**Rivaroxaban**|At least 2 days.|6 hours.
|**GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors**|At least 2 days. Seek expert advice.|Seek expert advice.
|**Thrombolytics**|10 days.|Measure fibrinogen level prior to removal. Seek expert advice.|


##Insertion
###Anatomy
Lumbar:

Thoracic:
* Avoid midline approach between T5 and T8

Cervical:
* Thin and soft ligamentum flavum leads to poor appreciation of LoR
* Space is ~ 1.5-2mm deep at C7, increases to 3-4mm with neck flexion

    * Anatomy
    * Equipment
    * Technique
        * Preparation
        * Procedure
        * Post
        * Removal

##Complications
* Hypotension
* Permanent nerve injury
    * Majority associated with motor block rather than pain
    * Poorer outcomes are associated with:
        * Delayed (> 24 hour) presention
        * No surgical intervention
* Urinary retention  
    * IDC placement
* Itch  
    * Due to presence of opioids within epidural
* Post-dural puncture headache
* High block
* Epidural abscess
Risk increases after 3 days.
* Nausea  
Typically indicates hypotension.
